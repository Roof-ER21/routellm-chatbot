## 🔄 Current Status

The batch processing has been started in the background. Here's how to monitor progress:

### Monitor Commands

```bash
# Check current progress
cat /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot/data/processed-kb/progress.json

# View processing log
tail -f /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot/processing.log

# Count completed documents
ls -1 /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot/data/processed-kb/documents/*.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# View latest processed document
ls -lt /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot/data/processed-kb/documents/*.json | head -1

# Check if still running
ps aux | grep "batch-process-documents"
```

## 📈 Expected Timeline

```
Start:    2025-10-30 [Current Time]
Progress: Processing in batches of 5
Expected: 2-4 hours total

Milestones:

## 🎯 Quality Checkpoints

Each document passes through 5 checkpoints:

### Checkpoint 1: Image Quality (60% threshold)
- File size validation
- Resolution check
- Buffer validity
- **Pass:** File is readable and processable

### Checkpoint 2: Text Extraction (50% threshold)
- DeepSeek vision model extraction
- Text completeness validation
- **Pass:** Sufficient text extracted

### Checkpoint 3: Structure Preservation (60% threshold)
- Headers detected
- Tables identified
- Lists recognized
- Paragraphs preserved
- **Pass:** Document structure maintained

### Checkpoint 4: Technical Accuracy (50% threshold)
- Roofing terms identified (80+ terms)
- Insurance terms identified (50+ terms)
- Code citations found (IRC, IBC, GAF)
- **Pass:** Technical content recognized

### Checkpoint 5: Cross-Reference (60% threshold)
- Content completeness
- Character distribution
- Sentence structure
- **Pass:** Output quality validated

## 💰 Cost Tracking

### Real-time Cost Calculation
```
Per Document:
- DeepSeek OCR: ~$0.0008
- Tesseract (fallback): $0.0000
- Cached: $0.0000

Running Total:
- Documents 1-10:   ~$0.008
- Documents 1-50:   ~$0.040
- Documents 1-100:  ~$0.080
- Documents 1-142:  ~$0.114

Expected Final: $0.11-0.27
```

### Cost Optimization
The system automatically:
- ✅ Caches results (saves 30-60%)
- ✅ Falls back to Tesseract for simple docs
- ✅ Reuses processing when possible

## 🔍 Check Progress Anytime

### Quick Status Check
```bash
cd /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot

# How many processed?
ls -1 data/processed-kb/documents/*.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# What's the current status?
cat data/processed-kb/progress.json | grep -E "processedCount|successfulCount|failedCount"

# Any failures?
cat data/processed-kb/progress.json | grep -A 10 "failedDocuments"
```

### View Latest Document
```bash
# See the most recently processed document
ls -lt data/processed-kb/documents/*.json | head -1

# View its contents
cat $(ls -t data/processed-kb/documents/*.json | head -1) | head -30
```

---

## ⚠️ If Something Goes Wrong

### Processing Stopped?
```bash
# Check if still running
ps aux | grep "batch-process-documents"

# If stopped, resume from checkpoint
npm run process:batch
# Will automatically resume from last checkpoint
```

### Too Many Failures?
```bash
# Check what's failing
cat data/processed-kb/progress.json | grep -A 20 "failedDocuments"

# Common issues:
# - Corrupted files → Skip and process manually later
# - Network issues → Script auto-retries
# - Rate limits → Script has built-in delays
```

### Out of Memory?
```bash
# Restart with more memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run process:batch
```

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

### Good Signs
- ✅ Progress updates every ~5-10 minutes
- ✅ Quality scores averaging >80
- ✅ Most checkpoints passing (>90%)
- ✅ Failure rate <5%
- ✅ Costs tracking as expected (~$0.0008/doc)

### Warning Signs
- ⚠️ Many checkpoints failing (>20%)
- ⚠️ Quality scores consistently <60
- ⚠️ High failure rate (>10%)
- ⚠️ Processing stops for >15 minutes
- ⚠️ Costs exceeding $0.002/doc

If you see warning signs:
1. Let current batch finish
2. Check the progress.json for errors
3. Review failed documents
4. Consider manual review of problem files

---

## 📊 What Happens Next (After Completion)

### Immediate (Same Day)
1. ✅ Review processing report
2. ✅ Validate quality metrics
3. ✅ Check failed documents
4. ✅ Verify cost is <$0.30
5. ✅ Confirm 135+ documents processed

### Phase 3 Preparation (Next Day)
1. Review RAG architecture document
2. Set up Railway account (if needed)
3. Prepare PostgreSQL deployment
4. Review embedding strategy
5. Plan Redis cache setup

### Phase 3 Execution (Next Week)
1. Deploy PostgreSQL + pgvector (2-3 days)
2. Generate embeddings for all docs (1-2 days)
3. Set up Redis cache (1 day)
4. Test retrieval accuracy (1 day)
