# Customer Email Safeguards - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

Susan AI now includes **critical safeguards** to ensure she NEVER generates emails AS the homeowner, only FOR the homeowner to send. This prevents confusion and ensures proper email attribution.

## What Changed

### 1. Template Metadata Enhancement

Added `sender` field to `EmailTemplate` interface:
- `sender: 'rep'` - Rep sends this email (default)
- `sender: 'customer'` - Homeowner sends this email

### 2. Customer-Sent Templates Identified

Two new templates added with `sender: 'customer'`:
1. **Appraisal Request (Customer Sends)** - Formal appraisal process request
2. **Customer to Insurance Escalation (Customer Sends)** - Management escalation

### 3. Automatic Instruction Headers

When generating customer-sent emails, Susan automatically includes:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
INSTRUCTIONS FOR [CUSTOMER_NAME]:

This email is drafted for YOU to send directly to the insurance company.

✅ Copy the email content below (starting from the greeting)
✅ Send it from YOUR email address to [insurance_email]
✅ CC me ([REP_NAME] at [REP_EMAIL]) so I can monitor the response

DO NOT have [REP_NAME] send this on your behalf - it must come from you
for maximum impact with the insurance company.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

```

### 4. UI Warning Banner

When a customer-sent template is selected, EmailGenerator displays:

```
⚠️ CUSTOMER-SENT EMAIL

This email is for the HOMEOWNER to send (not you, the rep).
Susan will include clear instructions at the top of the email explaining that
the homeowner must copy and send it from their own email address.
```

### 5. Correct Signatures

- **Customer-sent emails**: Signed by the homeowner's name
- **Rep-sent emails**: Signed by rep name + "Roof-ER Claims Advocacy"

## Example Output

### Customer-Sent Email (Appraisal Request)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
INSTRUCTIONS FOR JOHN SMITH:

This email is drafted for YOU to send directly to the insurance company.

✅ Copy the email content below (starting from the greeting)
✅ Send it from YOUR email address to claims@stateauto.com
✅ CC me (Mike Johnson at mike@roofer.com) so I can monitor the response

DO NOT have Mike Johnson send this on your behalf - it must come from you
for maximum impact with the insurance company.

Dear Claims Adjuster,

I am writing regarding my insurance claim CLM-2024-12345.

I strongly disagree with the current estimate and am formally requesting
the appraisal process under my policy.

1. Specific disagreements with estimate
2. Reference to policy's appraisal clause
3. Request for appraisal umpire selection process
4. Timeline expectations per policy

Please initiate the appraisal process immediately and provide details on
selecting appraisers.

I expect a response within 10 business days as required by my policy.

Sincerely,

John Smith
```

### Rep-Sent Email (Code Violation) - No Instructions

```
Dear Claims Adjuster,

This is Mike Johnson with Roof-ER assisting John Smith regarding claim CLM-2024-12345.

Attached are our documentation including photos and code citations.

1. IRC R908.3 requires complete matching of shingles
2. State building code mandates compliance
3. Manufacturer specifications require matching

Please provide a revised estimate reflecting full replacement.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Best regards,

Mike Johnson
Roof-ER Claims Advocacy
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/lib/template-service-simple.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `sender?: 'rep' | 'customer'` to `EmailTemplate` interface
- Added 2 new customer-sent templates with `sender: 'customer'`
- Updated `generateEmailFromTemplate()` to:
  - Detect customer-sent templates
  - Add instruction header automatically
  - Use correct signature (customer name vs rep name)

### 2. `/app/components/EmailGenerator.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added yellow warning banner when `selectedTemplate.sender === 'customer'`
- Updated AI prompt to include customer-sent email safeguard instructions
- Banner appears above template selector when customer-sent template is active

## Testing

Run the test script to verify implementation:

```bash
node test-customer-email.mjs
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Customer email has instruction header: ✅
✅ Customer email has warning message: ✅
✅ Customer email signed by customer: ✅
✅ Rep email has NO instructions: ✅
✅ Rep email signed by rep: ✅

✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## Build Status

✅ Build passes with no errors
✅ TypeScript types are valid
✅ All tests pass

## Usage for Reps

### When generating customer-sent emails:

1. Select template (e.g., "Appraisal Request")
2. See yellow warning banner: "⚠️ CUSTOMER-SENT EMAIL"
3. Generate email
4. Email includes clear instructions at top
5. Rep gives entire email to homeowner
6. Homeowner copies content (starting from greeting)
7. Homeowner sends from their email, CCs rep

### When generating rep-sent emails:

1. Select template (e.g., "Code Violation")
2. No warning banner
3. Generate email
4. Email is ready for rep to send directly
5. No instruction header included

## Benefits

✅ **Prevents confusion** - Clear instructions prevent reps from sending customer emails
✅ **Maximum impact** - Insurance companies respond better to homeowner-sent emails
✅ **Proper attribution** - Emails are signed by correct sender
✅ **Rep monitoring** - Rep stays CC'd to track responses
✅ **Foolproof** - Visual warning + text instructions make it impossible to miss

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add more customer-sent templates (complaint to state commissioner, etc.)
- Track when homeowners actually send vs when reps incorrectly send
- Add email tracking to confirm homeowner sent it
- Analytics on response rates for customer-sent vs rep-sent emails
