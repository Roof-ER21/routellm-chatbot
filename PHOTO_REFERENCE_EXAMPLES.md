# Photo Reference Examples

This document provides practical examples of how Susan AI-21 can use inline photo references in responses.

## Example 1: Basic Installation Question

**User Query:**
```
where's drip edge installed?
```

**Susan Response:**
```
Drip edge [PHOTO:drip edge:1] [PHOTO:drip edge:2] is a critical metal flashing component installed along the edges of your roof. Here's where it goes:

Installation Locations:
1. Along all eaves (bottom edges of the roof)
2. Along all rakes (side edges/gable ends)
3. Extends about 2-3 inches out from the roof edge

The drip edge serves to:
- Direct water away from fascia boards
- Guide water into gutters
- Prevent water from wicking back under shingles
- Protect the roof deck edges

It should be installed UNDER the ice and water shield [PHOTO:ice and water shield:1] along the eaves and OVER it along the rakes.
```

## Example 2: Damage Identification

**User Query:**
```
show me examples of hail damage
```

**Susan Response:**
```
Here are examples of common hail damage patterns [PHOTO:shingle damage:1] [PHOTO:shingle damage:2] on roofing systems:

Types of Hail Damage:
1. Bruising - Dark spots where granules are knocked off
2. Cracks - Impact fractures in the shingle mat
3. Granule Loss - Exposed asphalt showing through
4. Punctures - Holes from large hailstones

The test square [PHOTO:test square:1] method helps document damage density for insurance claims. Look for:
- Multiple impacts per square foot
- Random scatter pattern (not in lines)
- Damage on all roof facets
- Matching damage on vents, flashing, gutters
```

**Visual Result:**
> Here are examples of common hail damage patterns [ðŸ“·] [ðŸ“·] on roofing systems...
> (Three thumbnails total, showing actual damage photos)

## Example 3: Flashing Installation

**User Query:**
```
how is step flashing installed at chimneys?
```

**Susan Response:**
```
Step flashing [PHOTO:step flashing:1] [PHOTO:step flashing:2] at chimneys requires a multi-layer approach:

Step-by-Step Installation:
1. Base/Apron Flashing - Installed at the front (downslope side)
2. Step Flashing - Individual pieces along both sides
   - Each piece overlaps the one below by 2+ inches
   - Installed with each course of shingles
   - One leg under shingles, one leg against chimney

3. Cricket/Saddle - Behind chimney (if over 30" wide)
4. Counter Flashing [PHOTO:counter flashing:1] - Covers step flashing
   - Cut into chimney mortar joints
   - Overlaps step flashing by 3-4 inches
   - Sealed with high-quality sealant

The chimney [PHOTO:chimney:1] shows proper installation with all components working together to create a watertight seal.
```

**Visual Result:**
> Step flashing [ðŸ“·] [ðŸ“·] at chimneys requires...
> (Four thumbnails showing different flashing types)

## Example 4: Ventilation Systems

**User Query:**
```
what types of roof vents are there?
```

**Susan Response:**
```
There are several roof ventilation systems commonly used:

Ridge Vents [PHOTO:ridge vent:1] [PHOTO:ridge vent:2]:
- Run along the entire roof peak
- Provide continuous exhaust ventilation
- Most effective when paired with soffit intake vents
- Nearly invisible when properly installed

Exhaust Caps [PHOTO:exhaust cap:1] [PHOTO:exhaust cap:2]:
- Individual penetration vents
- Used for plumbing stacks, kitchen/bath exhaust
- Come in various sizes (typically 3-4 inches)
- Require proper flashing and sealing

Proper ventilation prevents:
- Ice dam formation
- Premature shingle aging
- Moisture buildup in attic spaces
- Excessive energy costs

The ratio should be 1:300 (1 sq ft of vent per 300 sq ft of attic) with balanced intake/exhaust.
```

## Example 5: Multi-Component Response

**User Query:**
```
explain proper roof edge details
```

**Susan Response:**
```
Proper roof edge details involve multiple integrated components:

1. Drip Edge [PHOTO:drip edge:1]:
   - First line of defense at roof perimeter
   - Installed before shingles
   - Extends beyond fascia

2. Ice and Water Shield [PHOTO:ice and water shield:1]:
   - Self-adhering membrane
   - Covers first 3-6 feet from edge (climate dependent)
   - Creates watertight seal

3. Starter Course:
   - Special shingles or cut strip shingles
   - Provides proper seal for first course
   - Prevents wind uplift

4. Gutter System [PHOTO:gutter:1] [PHOTO:gutter:2]:
   - Collects and diverts water
   - Proper slope (1/4" per 10 feet)
   - Clean and debris-free

5. Soffit and Fascia [PHOTO:overhang:1]:
   - Protect rafter tails
   - Provide intake ventilation
   - Aesthetic finish

All these components work together to protect your roof edge from water infiltration and structural damage.

## Example 6: Valley Types

**User Query:**
```
what are the different valley types?
```

**Susan Response:**
```
Roof valleys [PHOTO:valley:1] [PHOTO:valley:2] come in three main types:

1. Open Metal Valley:
   - Metal channel down the valley
   - Shingles cut back from center
   - Best water flow
   - Most durable
   - Recommended for heavy rain areas

2. Woven Valley:
   - Shingles from both slopes interwoven
   - Traditional method
   - More labor intensive
   - Good water protection

3. Cut/Closed Valley:
   - Shingles from one slope overlap valley
   - Shingles from other slope cut to center
   - Clean appearance
   - Common on modern roofs

All valleys should have ice and water shield [PHOTO:ice and water shield:1] underneath for extra protection. Valleys are high-stress areas that channel large volumes of water.
```

## Example 7: Skylight Installation

**User Query:**
```
how should skylights be flashed?
```

**Susan Response:**
```
Proper skylight [PHOTO:skylight:1] [PHOTO:skylight:2] flashing is critical:

Flashing Kit Components:
1. Head Flashing (top) - Diverts water around skylight
2. Step Flashing (sides) - Individual pieces with each course
3. Sill Flashing (bottom) - Collects water at base

Installation Sequence:
- Ice and water shield under all flashing
- Sill flashing installed first
- Step flashing [PHOTO:step flashing:1] with each shingle course
- Head flashing installed last
- Proper overlap at all corners

Key Points:
- Factory flashing kits are recommended
- Custom flashing for unusual situations
- All skylight flashing [PHOTO:skylight flashing:1] should integrate with roof system
- Proper slope and drainage essential
- Sealant alone is NEVER sufficient

A properly flashed skylight should last 20+ years without leaks.
```

## Example 8: Interior/Attic Inspection

**User Query:**
```
what should I look for in the attic?
```

**Susan Response:**
```
Attic inspection [PHOTO:interior:1] reveals critical roof and ventilation issues:

Things to Check:

1. Moisture/Water Stains:
   - Dark spots on decking
   - Mold or mildew growth
   - Rust on nails/fasteners
   - Indicates active or past leaks

2. Ventilation Adequacy:
   - Light visible at soffit vents
   - Ridge vent [PHOTO:ridge vent:1] opening clear
   - No blocked insulation at eaves
   - Proper airflow from soffit to ridge

3. Structural Issues:
   - Sagging rafters or decking
   - Broken or cracked framing
   - Improper repairs or modifications

4. Insulation:
   - Adequate depth (R-38 to R-60 depending on climate)
   - Not compressed or disturbed
   - Not covering ventilation paths

5. Penetrations:
   - Exhaust caps [PHOTO:exhaust cap:1] properly sealed
   - No light visible around penetrations
   - Flashing visible and intact

Regular attic inspections (twice yearly) help catch problems before they cause major damage.

## Usage Guidelines for Susan

### When to Use Photo References

1. **Visual Identification Questions:**
   - "What does X look like?"
   - "Where is X located?"
   - "Show me examples of X"

2. **Installation/Repair Instructions:**
   - When explaining proper installation
   - When describing component placement

   - Comparing good vs. bad conditions
   - Teaching damage recognition

4. **Component Explanations:**
   - Introducing new terms
   - Explaining multiple related components
   - Showing context of installation

### Best Practices

1. **Limit to 2-4 Photos Per Section:**
   - Don't overwhelm with too many thumbnails

   - Use index 1 for primary example
   - Use index 2 for alternative view
   - Keep terms consistent with photo index

4. **Natural Placement:**
   - Place photos near first mention of term
   - Don't break sentence flow
   - Use at logical pause points

### Terms with Rich Photo Libraries

These terms have multiple examples available:
- `drip edge` - 15+ examples
- `step flashing` - 12+ examples
- `chimney` - 10+ examples
- `ridge vent` - 8+ examples
