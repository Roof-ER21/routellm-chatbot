## System Architecture

### 1. Conversational Flow Service
**File:** `/Users/a21/routellm-chatbot/lib/conversational-flow-service.ts`

**Purpose:** Intelligent question generation and intelligence gathering

**Key Functions:**
- `getInitialQuestions()` - Generates context-aware first questions
- `generateFollowUpQuestions()` - Creates targeted follow-ups based on responses
- `parseIntelligenceFromResponse()` - Extracts structured data from user answers
- `buildEnhancedEmailPrompt()` - Constructs evidence-based prompt with gathered intelligence
- `hasEnoughIntelligence()` - Validates if sufficient data collected

**Question Types:**

**For Adjuster Emails:**
```
1. What did the adjuster approve/deny?
2. What's the main issue?
3. Do you have documentation?
```

**Follow-up questions adapt based on responses:**
- Partial approval → Ask about slopes, jurisdiction, manufacturer
- Denial → Ask about reason, counter-evidence, building codes
- Storm damage → Ask about iTel data, impact counts, test squares
- "Cosmetic" → Ask about functional damage evidence

**For Homeowner Emails:**
```
1. What is the homeowner worried about?
2. Where are we in the claim process?
3. Communication preference (technical vs simple)?
```

## Email Generation Process

### Step 1: Initial Form
User enters basic information:
- Email type (adjuster, homeowner, etc.)
- Recipient name
- Claim number (optional)
- Additional details (optional)
- Upload documents (optional)

### Step 2: Choose Mode

**Option A: Intelligent Email Builder (RECOMMENDED)**
- Starts conversational intelligence gathering
- Susan asks 1-3 targeted questions
- May ask follow-up questions based on responses
- Shows intelligence summary before generation

**Option B: Quick Generate**
- Uses only information from form
- Less effective, generic output
- Fallback for simple emails

### Step 3: Intelligence Gathering (Mode A only)
Susan asks questions like:
```
"I'll help you craft a winning argument for John Smith.
First, let me understand the situation:

1. What did the adjuster approve or deny?
2. What's the main issue you need to address?
3. Do you have documentation ready?"
```

Rep responds with details. Susan may ask follow-ups:
```
"Got it - partial approval for matching shingle requirement.
A few more details:

1. What jurisdiction is this? (State/county for building code citation)
2. Do you have photos showing damage on other slopes?
3. Have they mentioned any reason for limiting to front slope only?"
```

### Step 4: Intelligence Summary
Shows gathered intelligence:
- Situation summary
- Evidence available
- Issues to address
- Jurisdiction
- Manufacturer info

Rep can edit or proceed.

### Step 5: Email Generation
Susan generates email using:
- Gathered intelligence
- Selected template (auto-matched or manual)
- Selected arguments (auto-selected high-success ones)
- Enhanced prompt with Fact-Value-Policy structure

### Step 6: Enhanced Preview
Shows:
- Success metrics (rate, quality score)
- Quality indicators (codes, specs, structure)
- Full email with subject and body
- Explanation of why it works
- Copy to clipboard button
- Usage tips

## Fact-Value-Policy Email Structure

### FACT STATEMENT
**Objective, verifiable reality**

Example:
```
The inspection documented 47 hail impacts across 850 sq ft
on the north slope, as shown in the attached 24-photo
documentation package dated March 15, 2024.
```

**Requirements:**
- Specific numbers, measurements, dates
- Reference to attached documentation
- No opinions or subjective statements

### VALUE STATEMENT
**Why facts matter - connect to codes/standards**

Example:
```
This level of damage compromises waterproofing integrity
per NRCA guidelines and violates IRC R908.3 matching
requirements. Maryland Building Code Section R908.3
specifically states: "Replacement materials must match
the existing roof in color, size, and quality."
```

**Requirements:**
- Code citations with VERBATIM text
- Section numbers (IRC R908.3, IBC 1510.3, etc.)
- Manufacturer specifications
- Industry standards (NRCA, ASTM)
- Consequences of non-compliance

### POLICY REQUEST
**What must happen - clear demand**

Example:
```
I respectfully request approval for full roof replacement
per the attached estimate totaling $18,500, to ensure
compliance with Maryland Building Code R908.3 and preserve
the manufacturer's warranty coverage.
```

**Requirements:**
- Specific action requested
- Based on facts and values presented
- Professional language ("I respectfully request" not "you must")
- Reference to timeline if applicable

---

## Code Citation Requirements

### ✅ CORRECT Examples

**IRC R908.3 (Verbatim Quote):**
```
IRC Section R908.3 states: "Reroofing shall be permitted
when the existing roof has not more than one application
of any type of roof covering...Replacement materials must
match the existing roof covering in color, size, and quality."
```

**State-Specific Code:**
```
Maryland Building Code Section R908.3, adopted from the
International Residential Code, mandates: "Replacement
materials must match the existing roof in color, size,
and quality." This is enforced by the Maryland Department
of Labor through local building inspectors.
```

**Manufacturer Specification:**
```
According to GAF's Installation Standards Manual (Section 3.2):
"Repairs must use matching shingles from the same product line.
Using non-matching materials voids the manufacturer warranty
and may create installation defects."
```

### ❌ WRONG Examples

**Generic/Vague:**
```
Building codes require matching materials.
```

**Paraphrased:**
```
The IRC says you need to match shingles when replacing a roof.
```

**Missing Section Number:**
```
The International Residential Code requires matching.
```

## Supporting Documentation

Every adjuster email must list attachments:

```
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION ATTACHED:
1. Photo_Documentation.pdf - 24 images showing multi-slope damage
2. Maryland_Building_Code_R908.3.pdf - Full code text with highlighting
3. CertainTeed_Matching_Requirements.pdf - Manufacturer specifications
4. iTel_Weather_Verification.pdf - Hail data for March 15, 2024
5. Previous_Approval_Precedents.pdf - 3 similar Maryland claims
   approved for full replacement
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows organization and professionalism
- Makes adjuster's job easier
- Demonstrates thorough preparation
- Harder to deny when everything is provided

---

## Tone Guidelines

### For Adjuster Emails
**Formula:** Firm on facts, warm in delivery

**Do:**
- ✅ "I respectfully request"
- ✅ "We need to ensure code compliance"
- ✅ "Thank you for your attention to this matter"
- ✅ "I'm available to discuss this further"
- ✅ "Please let me know if you need additional information"

**Don't:**
- ❌ "You must comply"
- ❌ "This is unacceptable"
- ❌ "Would you be available for a call?" (except reinspection)
- ❌ "Let me walk you through this"
- ❌ Emotional appeals ("imagine how the homeowner feels")

### For Homeowner Emails
**Formula:** Warm, confident, supportive

**Do:**
- ✅ "Don't worry, we've got this!"
- ✅ "This is common - here's what we're doing"
- ✅ "You're in good hands"
- ✅ "I'm handling all communication with the insurance company"
- ✅ "Call or text me anytime with questions"

**Don't:**
- ❌ Insurance jargon (use simple language)
- ❌ Technical code discussions (unless they ask)
- ❌ Uncertainty ("I'll try to..." → "I'm working on...")
- ❌ Overpromising specific outcomes

---

## Quality Checks

The system automatically validates:

### Citation Check
- Are building codes cited with section numbers?
- Is code text quoted verbatim (not paraphrased)?
- Are manufacturer specs referenced?

### Structure Check
- Does email follow Fact-Value-Policy format?
- Is there a clear policy request?
- Are facts supported by evidence?

### Documentation Check
- Are attachments listed explicitly?
- Is each attachment described?
- Does attachment list match evidence discussed?

### Tone Check
- No emotional appeals (adjuster emails)
- No meeting requests (except reinspection)
- No Roof-ER promotion (adjuster emails)
- Professional confidence maintained

### Quality Score
- 4/4 = All checks passed (excellent)
- 3/4 = Most checks passed (good)
- 2/4 = Some checks passed (needs improvement)
- 1/4 = Few checks passed (revise)
- 0/4 = No checks passed (start over)

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Partial Approval Appeal

**Step 1: Form Entry**
- Email Type: "Partial Denial Appeal"
- Recipient: "Jennifer Adams"
- Claim: "MD-2024-8472"

**Step 2: Susan's First Question**
```
I'll help you craft a winning argument for Jennifer Adams.
First, let me understand the situation:

1. What did the adjuster approve or deny?
2. What's the main issue you need to address?
3. Do you have documentation ready?
```

**Step 3: Rep Response**
```
They approved front slope only (12 squares). Homeowner has
GAF Timberline shingles. We have photos showing hail damage
on all 4 slopes (38 total squares). iTel shows 1.25" hail
on March 3rd. Adjuster said back slopes are "cosmetic."
```

**Step 4: Susan's Follow-Up**
```
Got it - partial approval for matching shingle requirement.
A few more details:

1. What jurisdiction is this property in? (State/county)
2. Do you have photos showing damage on other slopes?
3. Did they mention any specific reason for limiting scope?
```

**Step 5: Rep Response**
```
Baltimore County, Maryland. Yes, we have 47 photos total
showing impacts on all slopes. They said only front slope
shows "functional damage" - rest is cosmetic wear.
```

**Step 6: Intelligence Summary**
```
✅ Intelligence Gathered!

Situation: Partial approval (front slope only, 12 sq) vs
full damage (38 sq total, all slopes)

Evidence Available:
• 47 photos showing multi-slope damage
• iTel weather verification (1.25" hail, March 3)
• GAF Timberline shingles

Issues to Address:
• "Cosmetic" vs functional damage argument
• Matching shingle requirement (Maryland R908.3)
• GAF warranty preservation

Jurisdiction: Baltimore County, Maryland
```

**Step 7: Generated Email**
```
Subject: Claim MD-2024-8472 - Maryland Building Code R908.3
Compliance Required

Dear Jennifer Adams,

Thank you for the initial approval on Claim MD-2024-8472
for the front slope replacement at [address]. However, I
must respectfully request reconsideration of the scope based
on Maryland building code requirements.

FACT: The inspection documented hail damage across all four
roof slopes, as shown in the attached 47-photo documentation
package. iTel weather verification confirms 1.25" hail on
March 3, 2024 at this property location. The existing roof
consists of GAF Timberline shingles.

VALUE: Maryland Building Code Section R908.3 specifically
requires: "Replacement materials must match the existing roof
in color, size, and quality." This is not optional—it is a
mandatory code requirement enforced by Baltimore County building
inspectors. Additionally, GAF's Installation Standards Manual
states: "Repairs must use matching shingles from the same
product line. Using non-matching materials voids the manufacturer
warranty."

Replacing only the front slope creates a visible mismatch that:
1. Fails Maryland Building Code compliance
2. Voids the GAF manufacturer warranty (per warranty terms)
3. Requires Baltimore County building permit denial
4. Exposes the homeowner to future liability

Regarding the "cosmetic damage" classification: The documented
hail impacts show compromised granule adhesion and seal integrity
across all slopes. This is functional damage affecting
waterproofing performance, not cosmetic wear. Per NRCA standards,
any damage compromising the waterproofing membrane constitutes
functional damage requiring repair.

POLICY: Based on Maryland Building Code R908.3, GAF warranty
requirements, and documented multi-slope damage, I respectfully
request approval for full roof replacement (38 squares total)
to ensure code compliance and warranty preservation.

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION ATTACHED:
1. Photo_Documentation.pdf - 47 images showing all-slope damage
2. Maryland_Building_Code_R908.3.pdf - Full code text
3. GAF_Timberline_Specifications.pdf - Warranty requirements
4. iTel_Weather_Verification.pdf - 1.25" hail data, March 3, 2024
5. Baltimore_County_Permit_Requirements.pdf - Code enforcement

This approach succeeds in 92% of similar Maryland cases. I am
available to discuss this further and can provide additional
documentation as needed.

Respectfully,
[Rep Name]
Roof-ER Claims Advocacy Team
```

**Step 8: Quality Metrics Shown**
- Success Rate: 92%
- Quality Score: 4/4
- ✅ Building Code Citations
- ✅ Manufacturer Specifications
- ✅ Fact-Value-Policy Structure
- ✅ Supporting Documentation

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Quality score is low (1/4 or 2/4)"
**Solution:** Try the Intelligent Builder instead of Quick Generate. Answer Susan's questions with specific details.

### "Email seems generic"
**Solution:** Provide more specific information:
- Exact slopes/areas approved vs denied
- Specific manufacturer and product line
- Jurisdiction (state AND county)
- Evidence counts (# of photos, hail size, etc.)

### "Missing code citations"
**Solution:** The system should auto-include these. If missing:
1. Check if you mentioned jurisdiction
2. Try regenerating with state/county specified
3. Manually add from argument library if needed

### "Template doesn't match my situation"
**Solution:**
1. Check email type selection (adjuster vs homeowner)
2. Review intelligence summary - may need to clarify situation
3. Use "Edit Responses" to provide better context

---
