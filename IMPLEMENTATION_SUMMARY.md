# Implementation Complete: Customer Email Safeguards

## Mission Accomplished ✅

Susan AI now has **critical safeguards** to ensure she NEVER generates emails AS the homeowner, only FOR the homeowner to send.

## What Was Built

### 1. Template System Enhancement
- Added `sender` field to EmailTemplate interface
- Identifies who sends the email: `'rep'` or `'customer'`

### 2. New Customer-Sent Templates
```typescript
- "Appraisal Request (Customer Sends)" - sender: 'customer'
- "Customer to Insurance Escalation (Customer Sends)" - sender: 'customer'
```

### 3. Automatic Instruction Headers
Customer-sent emails now include:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
INSTRUCTIONS FOR [CUSTOMER_NAME]:

This email is drafted for YOU to send directly to the insurance company.

✅ Copy the email content below (starting from the greeting)
✅ Send it from YOUR email address to [insurance_email]
✅ CC me ([REP_NAME] at [REP_EMAIL]) so I can monitor the response

DO NOT have [REP_NAME] send this on your behalf - it must come from you
for maximum impact with the insurance company.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4. UI Warning Banner
Yellow warning appears when customer-sent template is selected:
```
⚠️ CUSTOMER-SENT EMAIL
This email is for the HOMEOWNER to send (not you, the rep).
```

### 5. Correct Signatures
- Customer-sent emails: Signed by homeowner's name
- Rep-sent emails: Signed by rep + "Roof-ER Claims Advocacy"

## Test Results

All tests pass:
```
✅ Customer email has instruction header: ✅
✅ Customer email has warning message: ✅
✅ Customer email signed by customer: ✅
✅ Rep email has NO instructions: ✅
✅ Rep email signed by rep: ✅

✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```
