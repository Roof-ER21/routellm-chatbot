Failed Repair = Full Replacement:\nIf shingles crack/break during manipulation (brittle test), repairs are not possible.\nUse Repair Attempt Template.\n2. Discontinued Shingles:\nUse GAF's discontinued list or iTel to prove repairs cannot be blended.\nMixing old/new is not acceptable.\n3. Slope Rule (Virginia):\nAsphalt shingles only allowed on slopes 2/12 or greater.\nFlatter slopes must use flat roof system.\n4. Siding Replacement (Maryland):\nPer code, housewrap & barrier required.\nReplacement of siding is often unavoidable due to code + mismatch issues.\n5. Flashing:\nCode requires replacing damaged/rusted flashings.\nInsurance cannot demand reuse.\n6. Storm Damage = Replacement:\nGAF states latent hail/wind damage (granule loss, cracks, mat exposure)\nleads to roof failure.\nPatch repairs not reliable.\n7. Partial Approvals:\nGAF slope replacement guidelines show disturbing adjacent slopes\nrequires full replacement of adjoining sections.\n8. Insurance Weather Data:\nAlways ask which source they used.\nCounter with iTel or HailTrace reports.\n9. Mismatch (Maryland):\nBulletin 18-23 requires insurers to address shade/texture mismatch.\nElsewhere, argue loss of value + discontinued product.\n10. Escalation Path:\n(1) Template fi (2) Code/Manufacturer Support fi (3) Homeowner Complaint\nfi (4) Arbitration/Appraisal if needed.\nFor Roof-ER field reps \u2013 Use this sheet during claims and adjuster meetings.",

There are no similar matches available. Even if a special order was attempted, it would require painting/matching that would not be cost-effective or compliant. The only way to make the homeowner whole is full siding replacement on all elevations.\n\ud83d\udccf Code Requirement Argument\nPer Maryland IRC 2018 R703.2 & R703.4, exterior walls must have a continuous weather-resistant barrier and flashing that overlaps correctly. To achieve this, housewrap must overlap at corners, requiring removal of adjacent siding panels. This removal causes consequential damage, making patch repair impractical or impossible.\n\nVirginia ICC Building Code also requires that damaged siding not be reinstalled (ICC 2021).\n\ud83d\udc64 Customer Escalation (if deni",

I founded this company in 2019, not because I have a passion for roofing or because I was born into a family of contractors, but because I saw an opportunity. An opportunity to change the reputation of roofing companies and contractors as a whole. This is an industry that is known for lack of communication, poor workmanship, used car sales techniques and straight up deceit by companies who still write up quotes with a pen and paper. With a little bit of modern thinking, integrity and hard work we\u2019ve been able to build a strong brand and reputation in a relatively short amount of time. From $2.5m in year one, as a one man sales team to $20m in 2023, we are one of the fastest growing roofing companies in the DMV. That growth has only been possible by attracting like minded people who are looking to change their lives and those around them\u2026 And we are just getting started! \nWe have ambitions of growing up and down the east coast and eventually becoming a national brand. To accomplish this we need to continue to add and develop hungry, competitive team members who are dedicated to the big picture but disciplined to execute on a day to day basis. \nWelcome to your new career!\nMy name is Reese Samala, Director of Sales, here at Roof-ER! I will be spending your first week here with you.  I am excited to see what you accomplish here with us.\nA quick introduction of who I am:\nI am a medically retired Infantryman",

Please state in your task if it is roof only or roof and siding.\nAfter the Hover is approved, you will receive an email from Hover with the PDF.  Once you receive that, it means your Hover is ready (if it is roof and siding, it will take a little bit longer to have the siding added as well.)\nOnce the Hover is complete, you will be able to download your own ESX, XML, or PDF.  You will also be able to see if your Hover is still processing and not ready for download yet.\nYou will do this through your internet browser; this can be done on a computer, ipad, or on your phone.  Go to the website: Hover.to\nOnce you go there, search your customer\u2019s Job ID to find your customer. See the screenshot below.  The Job ID is 6902\nIf you manually created the hover (which you should not be doing) you will have to just search for the customer\u2019s hover that you manually created.\nOnce you open the file, you will click \u201cexport\u201d. See screenshot below\nYou will then download the ESX. See screenshot below\nESX is at the very bottom. Once you click that checkbox next to it, press download.  \nThe most effective way to get this to your adjuster is to: \nEmail this file to yourself. \nDownload the document(s) on your computer, phone or iPad.\nCompose a new email and send it to your adjuster. (This way you can write the subject, write the note, and it should have your signature at the bottom of the email.)",

The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that\namount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\nNon-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\nExample: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and\ndecides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\nImportant for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it \u2014\nit can\u2019t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.\nComplaint Forms\nHave HO use these websites to submit a complaint\nAllstate:\nNationwide:\nUnder \u201cWhat is your Email About\u201d Select \u201cGeneral Inquiries\u201d\nUnder \u201cWhat is the Subject of your Email\u201d Select \u201cFeedback & Complaints\u201d\nState Farm:\nSelect \u201cOther\u201d on drop down menu, and then click the link that says \u201cthis form\u201d\nErie:\nTravelers:\nIf you/HO already sent email(s) to\nUse this link to file a complaint:\nSelect \u201cGive complaint or Share a concern\u201d on the first drop down menu\nThen select \u201cYour Experience\u201d on the second drop down menu\nUnder the \u201crelationship\u201d drop down menu, HO should select \u201ccustomer\u201d\n(You shouldn\u2019t fill this form out often, but if you d",

This includes Code Items such as IWS and Drip Edge. And don\u2019t worry! Even if for some reason they do not approve these amounts, we will still do all the necessary work and never charge you for it.  As we talked about earlier, your only cost out of this will be your deductible once we finish all the work.\n\u201cUpon completion of the installation, we will review and inspect all of our work to ensure it is to your satisfaction.

I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake. \nTurn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see.\u00a0\n\u201cThis basic/simple agreement backs you as the homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost will be your deductible if we get you fully approved.

The Adjuster/Ladder Assist identified all the same damage as me.  You will be receiving an email from us shortly saying that you\u2019ve been fully approved.  Within a few days you should receive the itemized estimate from the Insurance Company.  Once you receive that, you can forward that to me. This is going to include every line item that the insurance company believes is needed to make you whole again. To you this is going to look like gibberish. But, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.

Any questions on that, sir/ma\u2019am?\u201d\nAnswer any questions\n\u201cWhen the insurance company generates their estimate, it will also typically trigger the release of the first payment. The insurance company refers to this payment as the ACV. Which stands for Actual Cash Value. That amount will be used as your down payment.  The remaining funds are held by the insurance company until we complete the work. They refer to these remaining funds as Depreciation. Which is not \u201cdepreciation\u201d as most would think about it, it\u2019s just their way of holding on to some of the funds to make sure the work gets done.\n\u201cAt the same time our office will be reviewing your entire project along with my photos and the insurance estimate. As I\u2019ve mentioned, insurance companies are always trying to save money.  We usually find specific line items that are missing. Most commonly, code items like IWS and Drip Edge. We will supplement for all the items needed to complete your project to code and our manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Don\u2019t worry, like we have agreed to from the beginning, we guarantee you that you would not have to cover any of these costs even if the insurance company were to deny our supplement. [Which d",

Due to the brittleness of the roof in general, during the repair the two rows of shingles above the one we were attempting to replace sustained unavoidable mechanical creasing.

    "content": "What is a homeowners deductible?\n- A homeowners insurance deductible is the amount a homeowner\nmust pay out of pocket before their insurance coverage applies.\nWhen a claim is approved, the insurance company will cover the\ntotal damage cost minus the deductible amount.\n- The terminology can be confusing, it may be helpful to think of it as\na copay, like when you go to the doctor.\n- It is important to note that if a deductible is not paid, there can be\nlegal consequences and any deprecation and/or PWI will be\nforfeited.\nTo whom is the deductible paid to?\n- You don\u2019t pay your deductible directly to the insurance company\nlike a bill. Instead, it\u2019s deducted from your claim payout. You'll\ncover the remaining amount\u2014your deductible\u2014when paying the\ncontractor or company repairing the damage.\nPer-Claim Basis:\n- It is important to note that homeowners insurance deductibles\ndiFer from health insurance deductibles in that they are paid on a\nper-claim basis (per event), whereas a health insurance deductible\nhas a maximum annual out of pocket.\nLet\u2019s Run Two Examples:\n- In the first example, let\u2019s say your deductible is $2,000 and you file\na claim for storm damage to your roof. The insurance company\nthen approves the work for $20,000. The insurance writes the\nestimate, subtracts the deductible, and pays out $18,000 while the\nremaining $2,000 (your deductible) is paid to the contractor.\n- Now let\u2019s suppose your deductible is $1,000, and you file a claim\nfor storm damage to your gutters. The insurance company\napproves the claim and estimates the repair cost at $900. Since the\nrepair cost is less than your deductible, you\u2019ll be responsible for\ncovering the full amount.\nHere\u2019s what insurance companies and reporting agencies say:\n\u2022 Allstate\n\u2022 Travelers\n\u2022 Rocket Mortgage\n\u2022 USAA\n\u2022 State Farm\n\u2022 Forbes\n\u2022 Policygenius\nInsurance Claim Example (USAA):",

The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that amount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\n Non-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\n Example:\nThe arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and decides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\n Important for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it \u2014 it can\u2019t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.",

The Bulletin noted that replacement of\ndamaged siding with new siding may result in a mismatch between existing siding and newly\ninstalled siding due to color shade, texture or dimension. Bulletin No. 97-1 advised that if a\nmismatch occurs, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other less visible\nareas of the house to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged\nsiding on one or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or a monetary allowance to\nreflect diminution in value of the house caused by mismatch. Bulletin No. 97-1 also noted that\nthe law does not require a replacement cost policy to ensure in every instance the replacement of\nall siding, including undamaged siding, in order to eliminate or minimize mismatching. At the\nsame time, the MIA advised that insurers whose settlement practices failed to take into account\nmajor differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions would be subject to\nadministrative action ",

    "content": "Aluminum Siding Claims\nMIA BULLETIN NO. 97-1\nThe Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) has received numerous complaints\nfrom homeowners concerning the settlement practices of insurers of claims for damage to\naluminum siding from hail. These complaints allege practices by insurers of paying to\nreplace only those portions of siding that are physically damaged without regard to the\nmismatching between existing and new siding. Failure to adjust such claims in accordance\nwith policy provisions or the company\u2019s own operations or settlement guidelines may result\nin a finding that the insurer is in violation of Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code. This\nBulletin reiterates long-standing MIA policy regarding the settlement of such claims.\nThe MIA interprets Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, in the following manner\nas to claims for aluminum siding damage under a covered peril made under a \u201creplacement\ncost\u201d homeowner\u2019s policy. The replacement of damaged siding with new siding may result in\nmismatched siding between the existing siding and the newly replaced siding. In such cases\nof mismatching, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other areas of the\nhouse to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged siding on\none or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or an allowance to reflect\ndiminution in value of the house caused by the mismatch. While the MIA does not interpret a\nreplacement cost policy to require in every instance, replacement of all siding including\nundamaged siding in order to minimize mismatching, insurers whose settlement practices fail\nto take into account major differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions as\nprovided above may be subject to action under Section 230A.\nInsurers should inform their insureds of any appraisal rights under the policy where\nthere is disagreement on the amount of a covered loss.

This requires full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nPlease see the attached photo report documenting storm-related damage on multiple slopes. The photos clearly show creased and missing shingles, which are consistent with functional wind damage and cannot be repaired without causing further harm. Per standard industry practice, this constitutes irreparability, and a full replacement is required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. We respectfully request that your estimate be revised accordingly .\nQ2: Adjuster says: \n\u201cHail is cosmetic and doesn\u2019t affect function.\u201d\nShort Answer (with source):\nHail damage is not cosmetic \u2014 it causes granule loss, mat fractures, and sealant bond failures, per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states that hail damage is cosmetic only.
