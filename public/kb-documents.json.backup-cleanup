    "content": "Roof-ER Top 10 Quick Facts Cheat Sheet\n1. Failed Repair = Full Replacement:\nIf shingles crack/break during manipulation (brittle test), repairs are not possible.\nUse Repair Attempt Template.\n2. Discontinued Shingles:\nUse GAF's discontinued list or iTel to prove repairs cannot be blended.\nMixing old/new is not acceptable.\n3. Slope Rule (Virginia):\nAsphalt shingles only allowed on slopes 2/12 or greater.\nFlatter slopes must use flat roof system.\n4. Siding Replacement (Maryland):\nPer code, housewrap & barrier required.\nReplacement of siding is often unavoidable due to code + mismatch issues.\n5. Flashing:\nCode requires replacing damaged/rusted flashings.\nInsurance cannot demand reuse.\n6. Storm Damage = Replacement:\nGAF states latent hail/wind damage (granule loss, cracks, mat exposure)\nleads to roof failure.\nPatch repairs not reliable.\n7. Partial Approvals:\nGAF slope replacement guidelines show disturbing adjacent slopes\nrequires full replacement of adjoining sections.\n8. Insurance Weather Data:\nAlways ask which source they used.\nCounter with iTel or HailTrace reports.\n9. Mismatch (Maryland):\nBulletin 18-23 requires insurers to address shade/texture mismatch.\nElsewhere, argue loss of value + discontinued product.\n10. Escalation Path:\n(1) Template fi (2) Code/Manufacturer Support fi (3) Homeowner Complaint\nfi (4) Arbitration/Appraisal if needed.\nFor Roof-ER field reps – Use this sheet during claims and adjuster meetings.",

Mark the damaged tab (if applicable) and mark the bottom right corner with chalk of every shingle the Field Tech points out.\n Before you begin filming; take a before shot of the area where you will be extracting the shingle. Start recording,  “...Here we are at [HOMEOWNER’S HOUSE] performing a repair attempt on this storm damaged shingle. As you can see I have pre-marked every tab that will sustain unavoidable creasing due to the brittleness of the roof. Go ahead and get started Francisco/Ishmael”\nFilm the entire area where repair is going to occur, then go from the Wide camera shot to a low down side view camera angle, to show how the shingles get bent back/pried up during the process. Make sure to show on camera or explicitly mention the high amount\nrepair is going to occur, then go from the Wide camera shot to a low down side view camera angle, to show how the shingles get bent back/pried up during the process. Make sure to show on camera or explicitly mention the high amount of granule loss running down the roof.\nOnce the new shingle has been installed, hover the camera over the shingles and wipe your hand back and forth gently over the top of each tab that was pried up. Trace your finger along the crease and show it on camera, explain how each tab has now been mechanically creased and confirms the roof failed a “brittle test”.\nOnce you have finished recording your video. Take close-up after pictures of the browns above the replaced shingle. Draw an arrow to where the crease is on the shingle or point to it for the picture.\nChecklist for Post-Adjuster Meeting\nPhoto Report Complete\nUpload photo report from photos tab when you have good reception\nHover Complete\nMove Job File\nMost jobs should go to Estimate Pending (make sure to look at next item on this check list - very important when moving a job to Estimate Pending)\nJobs that you think are partial or denial will be moved to Decision Pending\nNote: This is the ONLY time you move a job\nPost-Adjuster Meeting Script\nRead it to your customer if you have to - much better than missing something\nMain emphasis should be for them to send you the estimate once they receive it\nPost-Adjuster Meeting Email\nPlease send Claim Authorization (and photo report when needed) to the adjuster after the AM.  Start with the Post AM Email Template\nPlease make sure all of these things are complete before the end of the day of an Adjuster Meeting\nPartials/Reinspects/Moving jobs\nSee above for when you should move a job to Decision Pending or Estimate Pending\nA job will be automatically moved for you after you submit the full approval, partial estimate, or denial letter (Do not move the job yourself to another stage here!)\nFor your jobs that are partial or denials - they will automatically be moved to one of two stages:\nPartial - Approval\nReinspection - Request Pending\nOnce your job is moved and you have a clear plan, make sure to execute\niTel\nRA\nReinspect\nCustomer Complaint Form\nEtc\nOnce you complete one of the above tasks:\nIf your job was in Partial - Approval, move job\njob is moved and you have a clear plan, make sure to execute\niTel\nRA\nReinspect\nCustomer Complaint Form\nEtc\nOnce you complete one of the above tasks:\nIf your job was in Partial - Approval, move job to Partial Pending - which will let the customer know that you have sent in your arguments and are awaiting additional communication or potentially an updated estimate to full approval\nIf your job was in Reinspection-Request Pending and the adjuster has confirmed they will be scheduling a reinspect, move job to Reinspection Pending\nOnce the reinspection has happened, ensure the same tasks that are listed under the Checklist for Post-Adjuster Meeting are completed\nIn most cases, the only item not completed there yet would be moving the job back to Decision or Estimate Pending",

Like they said, an adjuster will be reaching out to you in the next 24\nto 48 hours to schedule the inspection. The absolute most important part of this process is that I am\nat this inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. They are trying to mitigate their\nlosses after storms. I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake.\nTurn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see.\n“This basic/simple agreement backs you as the homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost\nwill be your deductible if we get you fully approved. If it is a partial approval or denial, first we will\nfight and jump through the necessary hoops to turn that into a full approval; but if we are not able to\nget you fully approved, this contract is null and void and you do not owe us a penny.”\n“What’s in it for us, is we just want to get to do the work. This agreement commits you to using us if\nwe hold up our end of the bargain and achieve a full-approval.”\nYou sign\nThey sign\n“This next form is our Claim Authorization form. Very simple, it allows us to communicate with your\ninsurance company. I’ll be here for the inspection and we will also communicate with them through\nemail and phone calls so you don’t have to be a middle-man. Of course, I’ll always keep you looped\nin with our communication by CCing you in all emails and updating you on any conversations we\nhave.\nThey sign\nPress Submit enter password “roofer” if it asks.\n“Alright, we are all set! Again, the most important part of this process is that I am here when the\ninsurance company comes out. Ideally you can have them call me to schedule that directly. If they\ncall me, great! But, regardless, please get the adjuster’s information (name, email, phone number)\nand send that over to me so that I can communicate with them before the inspection. If they insist\non scheduling with you, go ahead and pencil in a time and avoid these times and days [provide your\nschedule]\nAnswer any questions that the HO may have\n“Thank you, sir/ma’am, looking forward to seeing you on the day of inspection, you have my contact\ninformation on my card if you need anything else\ndays [provide your\nschedule]\nAnswer any questions that the HO may have\n“Thank you, sir/ma’am, looking forward to seeing you on the day of inspection, you have my contact\ninformation on my card if you need anything else.\nFull Approval Estimate Phone Call\nThis is the call you will make to your HO as soon as you receive the estimate\n“Hello sir/ma’am! It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. Congratulations, I am glad we were able to\nensure that your insurance company fully approved your roof/siding/gutters/etc replacement!\n“So the next steps are, as I mentioned last time we met:\n“One of our Project Coordinators will be reaching out to you to schedule a Project Meeting to go\nover your full scope of work.\n“Based on the estimate, your insurance company will be sending you [ACV AMOUNT] shortly. This\nwill be used as your down payment. With that, we can start all of your work! When they send you\nthat check, just hold on to it until your meeting with our Project Coordinator who will help with all the\nnext steps.\n“Our estimating team will also be sending in supplements to the insurance company based on items\nthey may have missed. This includes Code Items such as IWS and Drip Edge. And don’t worry!\nEven if for some reason they do not approve these amounts, we will still do all the necessary work\nand never charge you for it. As we talked about earlier, your only cost out of this will be your\ndeductible once we finish all the work.\n“Upon completion of the installation, we will review and inspect all of our work to ensure it is to your\nsatisfaction. Then we will send in a completion form once you sign off on the complete project.\nThat’s when the insurance company will release the remaining funds minus your deductible. So\nyour final payment will only be those funds plus your deductible.\n“Any questions so far, sir/ma’am?”\nAnswer any questions\n“Great! Again, I am glad that we were able to make this happen for you, now you get to experience\nthe quality that Roof ER always delivers, at only the cost of your deductible after your whole project\nis complete!” Potentially mention additional work that they may want to add.\nAnswer any additional questions or engage in any conversation the HO starts.\n“Also, if you know anyone else that I can help, have them reach out to me! You have my card - they\ncan call, text, or email me and I can inspect their property to see if they have the same qualifying\ndamage and I can walk them through the same process I have walked you\nthem reach out to me! You have my card - they\ncan call, text, or email me and I can inspect their property to see if they have the same qualifying\ndamage and I can walk them through the same process I have walked you through!\nEngage in any conversation that this starts\n“Awesome!\nIf you haven’t already put up a yard sign: “Would you mind if I put up a yard sign next time I’m in\nyour area? This will definitely help other companies already know that you’re working with someone\nand hopefully eliminate anyone else from knocking your door asking about your roof/siding.”\n“Look out for the communication from one of our Project Coordinators so you can get that Project\nMeeting scheduled to go over all the next steps and your full scope of work. Congratulations again\nand have a great day!”\nInitial Pitch\n5 Non-negotiables with every pitch\nWho you are\nWho we are and what we do (Roof ER)\nMake it relatable\nWhat you’re there to do (an inspection)\nGo for the close (them agreeing to the inspection)\nKnock on door/ring doorbell\nAs they are opening the door, smile and wave.\n“Hi, how are you? My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that\nspecializes in helping homeowners get their roof (and siding) replaced, paid for by their insurance!”\nGeneric:\n“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Philadelphia/Maryland over the past few\nmonths that have done a lot of damage!\n“We’re already working with your neighbors. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved\nthrough their insurance company to have their roof and/or siding replaced.”\n(Go to line marked with ^)\n-OR-\nSpecific\n“Were you home for the storm we had in ___. Wait for answer\nIf yes “It was pretty crazy right?! Wait for answer\nIf no: “Oh no worries at all, we get that all the time.\nIf yes move on to next line marked with *\nIf no “That’s good! It was a pretty bad one!”\n*“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully\napproved through their insurance company to have their roof (and siding) replaced.”\n^“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you\nhave similar, qualifiable damage. If you do, I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest\nof the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will\nat least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m\ngonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your\nroof.\nyour\nroof.\nGo in for a handshake. What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am\n(your name). Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their\nanswer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I will give you a knock when I\nfinish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection.

It\ndoesn’t matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you don’t have enough\ndamage-photos for the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim.\n§Flashlight\n\\\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nKnock on the door\n“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. First I walked around the perimeter of the\nhouse to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the\nroof.” Say this while going through through house number and overview photos\nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story. Think of us like lawyers\nand this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof (and\nsiding) approved.”\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage\n(IF there were any wind damaged shingles or missing shingles say:) and anything I have slashed\nmeans its wind damage.\nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is\ncircular in nature. Even if this damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these\nhail divots fill with water, freeze…., when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle\nwhich will eventually lead to leaks. That is why your insurance company is responsible and your\npolicy covers this type of damage.”\nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.\nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\nIf there was wind damage or missing shingles, say the following:\n“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have both shingles that are creased from the wind\nlifting them up and shingles that have completely been blown off.”\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles (if applicable)\nNow show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts\n“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be\nwhat’s protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your roof, it knocks out these granules which\nreduces the lifespan of your roof.”\n“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in\nthe area”.\n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s\nunfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when\nyour insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make\nsure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all\nthe damage that I just showed you.”\n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go\nget iPad\nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we\njust showed you.”\n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go\nget iPad\nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10\nMinutes”?\nOnce you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled.\n“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system. Then we can let\nyour insurance company know about the damagel”.\nGather information from the homeowner:\nFull name\nAddress\nPhone Number\nE-mail\nInsurance Company\n“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”!\nAfter you have collected all the information:\nAsk if they have the app or if they have the login to the website.\nIf not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO. As you are writing or typing the\ninformation for the HO to use on the call, explain each part to them.\nAs much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call\nReference Claim Filing Information Sheet\nMove on to Contingency & Claim Authorization\nPartial Estimate/Denial Phone Call\nThis is the call you will make to your HO as soon as you receive the estimate\n“Hello sir/ma’am! It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. How’s it going?”\n“Great, well we just received the decision from the insurance company. We’re going to have to take\nsome steps to get this turned around. I have already submitted my photo report that demonstrates\nthe damage to your property and the need to replace your whole roof, so hopefully they review and\napprove that. Could you please reach out to the adjuster to see if they were able to review my\nreport?”\nAfter HO answers. “Thank you! During that call, please let them know that you disagree with their\ncurrent decision and would like to have your property reinspected if they are not able to update their\ncurrent decision to a full approval based on the photo report that I sent them.”\nIf there are some approved shingles:\n“So we will also be conducting an iTel and Repair Attempt.\n“An iTel is where we will take a shingle off your roof and send it in to get tested to verify that it is\ndiscontinued. Since it is discontinued, the only effective way to restore your property would be with\na full roof replacement.\n“At that time, I will also take a video of us removing and replacing that shingle. This Repair Attempt\nvideo will demonstrate to the insurance company that your roof is not repairable and therefore\nwould need to be fully replaced.\n“To get those scheduled, I will need you to sign these 2 documents allowing us to do that. When\nyou see the documents, it will have a cost attached, but don’t worry! Read the bold print and you will\nsee that you, as the homeowner, are never responsible for this cost.”\nSchedule a time to meet with the HO to sign or let them know you will be sending it out for eSign.\nTask the proper people for eSign, if necessary.\n“We will definitely be putting in the work to give you the highest chance of getting this turned\naround. I definitely believe your roof has the damage that warrants a full replacement. But, of\ncourse, insurance companies are billion dollar, publicly traded companies that will try to save as\nmuch money as they can on every claim. That is why it is great that you are working with us since\nwe know the proper steps to ensure that you\ncourse, insurance companies are billion dollar, publicly traded companies that will try to save as\nmuch money as they can on every claim. That is why it is great that you are working with us since\nwe know the proper steps to ensure that you are adequately taken care of by your insurance\ncompany!”\nAnswer any questions or concerns the HO has.\n“Alright, so let me know how the phone call goes with your adjuster and I’ll start working on my end\nto put everything together to get this turned around. Thank you, sir/ma’am, goodbye!”\nPost Adjuster Meeting Script\nThis is the conversation you will have with the HO after an adjuster meeting\nIf moving to Estimate Pending:\n“Great! The Adjuster/Ladder Assist identified all the same damage as me. You will be receiving an\nemail from us shortly saying that you’ve been fully approved. Within a few days you should receive\nthe itemized estimate from the Insurance Company. Once you receive that, you can forward that to\nme. This is going to include every line item that the insurance company believes is needed to make\nyou whole again. To you this is going to look like gibberish. But, don’t worry, that’s what we’re here\nfor. If for some weird reason the desk adjuster does not write it for a full approval after this\ninspection, I will take the steps necessary to get it turned around! Any questions on that,\nsir/ma’am?”\nAnswer any questions\n“When the insurance company generates their estimate, it will also typically trigger the release of\nthe first payment. The insurance company refers to this payment as the ACV. Which stands for\nActual Cash Value. That amount will be used as your down payment. The remaining funds are held\nby the insurance company until we complete the work. They refer to these remaining funds as\nDepreciation. Which is not “depreciation” as most would think about it, it’s just their way of holding\non to some of the funds to make sure the work gets done.\n“At the same time our office will be reviewing your entire project along with my photos and the\ninsurance estimate. As I’ve mentioned, insurance companies are always trying to save money. We\nusually find specific line items that are missing. Most commonly, code items like IWS and Drip\nEdge. We will supplement for all the items needed to complete your project to code and our\nmanufacturer’s specifications. Don’t worry, like we have agreed to from the beginning, we\nguarantee you that you would not have to cover any of these costs even if the insurance company\nwere to deny our supplement. [Which does not happen.]\n“Once our office has completed your job review, which takes 2 - 3 business days, your job will be\nassigned to one of our Project Coordinators. They will reach out to schedule a project meeting\nwhere they will walk you through all of the finer details. This is the fun\ntakes 2 - 3 business days, your job will be\nassigned to one of our Project Coordinators. They will reach out to schedule a project meeting\nwhere they will walk you through all of the finer details. This is the fun part where you will get to pick\nour products and colors. *Of course if you have anything else you would like us to do beyond the\ninsurance approval, your Project Coordinator could price that out for you.*\n“Your install date will typically be 4 - 6 weeks after your Project Meeting. After you submit that initial\npayment from the insurance company, we’ll reach out to get your project scheduled!\n“I know that was a lot of information. The most important thing from here is forwarding the estimate\nas soon as you get it. Of course if you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to\nreach out.\nAnswer any questions that they may have.\n“A great way for me to help assist some of your neighbors, would be if I could put up a yard sign!\nWould you mind if I put one up? Thank you, sir/ma’am!”\nSubmit your Photo Report and Claim Authorization to the adjuster with an effective email. Use\nPost-AM-Email-Template if you need to.\nIf moving to Decision Pending:\n“So, we just finished our inspection. The Adjuster/Ladder Assist will be sending their report to a\ndesk adjuster and will be making a final decision. Once they make a decision, they will write up an\nitemized estimate and should send that over to you. Once you receive that, please forward that over\nto me. They can be a bit hard to read, so I’ll be able to walk through all of that with you.\n“If it comes back as anything other than a full approval, I’ll take the necessary steps to make sure it\ngets turned around! There are a lot of steps we can take from here, which we can go over once we\nreceive the estimate.\n“I will go over all this information again once we receive the estimate and have a more clear picture\nof what the next steps will be.”\nAnswer any questions they may have\n“Great! So, if you have any questions between now and when you get your estimate, please reach\nout! And, again, once you receive that from the insurance company, forward that over to me so I\ncan review that with you. Thank you sir/ma’am! Have a great day!”\nSubmit your Photo Report and Claim Authorization to the adjuster with an effective email.

The exterior wall envelope shall include flashing as described in Section R703.4.\nR703.1.1 Water resistance. The exterior wall envelope shall be designed and constructed in a\nmanner that prevents the accumulation of water within the wall assembly by providing a\nwater-resistant barrier behind the exterior veneer as required by Section R703.2 and a means of\ndraining to the exterior water that enters the assembly.\nImportance of Moisture Management\nR703.2 Water-resistive barrier. One layer of No. 15 asphalt felt, free from holes and breaks,\ncomplying with ASTM D226 for Type I felt or other approved water-resistive barrier shall be applied\nover studs or sheathing of all exterior walls. Such felt or material shall be applied horizontally, with\nthe upper layer lapped over the lower layer not less than 2 inches (51mm). Where joints occur, felt\nshall be lapped not less than 6 inches (152mm).

The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that\namount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\nNon-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\nExample: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and\ndecides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\nImportant for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it —\nit can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.\nComplaint Forms\nHave HO use these websites to submit a complaint\nAllstate:\nNationwide:\nUnder “What is your Email About” Select “General Inquiries”\nUnder “What is the Subject of your Email” Select “Feedback & Complaints”\nState Farm:\nSelect “Other” on drop down menu, and then click the link that says “this form”\nErie:\nTravelers:\nIf you/HO already sent email(s) to\nUse this link to file a complaint:\nSelect “Give complaint or Share a concern” on the first drop down menu\nThen select “Your Experience” on the second drop down menu\nUnder the “relationship” drop down menu, HO should select “customer”\n(You shouldn’t fill this form out often, but if you do there is an option to select “3rd party)”\nFarmers Insurance:\nGrange:\nSelect “Your Claim/Claim Status” on drop down menu\nHomsite:\nEmail\nLiberty Mutual:\nMercury:\nProgressive:\nClick “Send Email” and then select “Your Claim/Claims Process” on drop down menu\nThe Philadelphia Contributionship:\nUniversal Property Complaint Form:\nSelect “Feedback” on the drop down menu\nUniversal Property Document Sharing:\nUse this link when you need to send information/documents to the assigned adjuster at Universal\nProperty\nYou can even write emails in a google docs, download the file, and upload it to ClaimPath as a\n“correspondence letter”\nThe Hartford:\nMake sure HO includes the Claim Number when filling out the complaint\nVirginia Farm Bureau:\nCumberland Mutual\nFill out contact form and make request by using the link\nNorthern Neck\nScroll to the bottom of the page and fill out form there\nAlso has generic email claimreport@nnins.com\nAssurant\nUnfortunately there is no complaint form online.

We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof replaced.”\nSlide 5\nInitial Pitch\n“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do, I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nPause here – Wait for them to respond/agree.\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.\nGo in for a handshake. “What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am (your name). Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“I will give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection. (See Inspection and Post-Inspection Script for detailed next steps.)\nSlide 6\nInitial Pitch\nBreak into groups\nSwitch between Sales Rep and Homeowner\nRead the script a few times each\nSlide 7\nInitial Pitch\nStorm Environment\n“Were you home for the storm we had in ___.

This payment is called Actual Cash Value (ACV)\nYou receive $1,000 of the job at Downpayment.\nSlide 21\nThe Sales Cycle:\nInstall and Final Payment\nThe install will typically be scheduled in 4 – 6 weeks from the time that the Homeowner submits Downpayment\nAfter the install is complete, we will schedule a Quality Check and Wrap Up with the homeowner.\nThey will sign the Certificate of Completion here and we will submit this to the insurance company\nThe insurance company will then release the remaining funds. They call this payment Depreciation.\nThe Homeowner then submits Final Payment. This payment is a combination of the Depreciation plus their insurance deductible.\nOnce they submit Final Payment, you will receive the remaining 16% of the job.\nThe first 6 weeks, you get 16% of all completed jobs. After that, you have to qualify to get the max of 16%.\nSlide 22\nThe Sales Cycle:\nCommission %’s and Bonuses\nInsurance Sales\n$1000 paid on Downpayment\nTownhomes do not count as a sign/up sale unless:\nHas aluminum siding\nA minimum of 15sqs\nMarch - October\n10+ Sign ups: 16%\n8 - 9 Sign ups: 10%\nLess than 8 Sign ups: 6%\nNovember and February\n8+ Sign Ups: 16%\nLess than 8 Sign ups: 6%\nDecember and January\n4+ Sign ups: 16%\nLess than 4 Sign ups: 6%\nRetail\nNothing paid on Downpayment\nSolar: 2%\nOther than Solar: 2%\n15 Sign Ups or $200k in Revenue: $2k\n20 Sign Ups or $250k in Revenue: $4k\n25 Sign Ups or $300k in Revenue: $6k\n30 Sign Ups or $350k in Revenue: $10k\n35 Sign Ups or $400k in Revenue: $12k\n40 Sign Ups or $450k in Revenue: $16k\nPresident’s Club\n$2mil Annual Sales -or-\n$750k in 3 consecutive months in revenue\nThere will also be monthly incentives to earn additional bonuses, items (watches, golf clubs, etc), and events.\nAll bonuses and incentives are paid towards negative draw balance first\nRep has the option to receive bonus in first 90 days even if they have a negative draw balance\nSlide 23\nLeave Behinds\nMailers\nOvou\nSlide 24\nRecap\nPlease have Non-Storm Environment Initial Pitch completely memorized\nPlease always be safe when",

There are no similar matches available. Even if a special order was attempted, it would require painting/matching that would not be cost-effective or compliant. The only way to make the homeowner whole is full siding replacement on all elevations.\n📏 Code Requirement Argument\nPer Maryland IRC 2018 R703.2 & R703.4, exterior walls must have a continuous weather-resistant barrier and flashing that overlaps correctly. To achieve this, housewrap must overlap at corners, requiring removal of adjacent siding panels. This removal causes consequential damage, making patch repair impractical or impossible.\n\nVirginia ICC Building Code also requires that damaged siding not be reinstalled (ICC 2021).\n👤 Customer Escalation (if denial continues)\nHave the homeowner send the 'Customer to Insurance' template email. This makes the pushback stronger since it comes directly from the policyholder. If still denied, file a complaint with the state insurance administration (e.g., Maryland Bulletin 18-23 for siding mismatch).\n📎 Attachments Checklist\n☑ Photo Report\n☑ iTel Report\n☑ Discontinued Shingle/Siding List (if applicable)\n☑ Building Code Reference (\ne.g., Maryland Bulletin 18-23 for siding mismatch).\n📎 Attachments Checklist\n☑ Photo Report\n☑ iTel Report\n☑ Discontinued Shingle/Siding List (if applicable)\n☑ Building Code Reference (R703 / ICC)\n☑ Claim Authorization (if needed)",

Mark the damaged tab (if applicable) and mark the bottom right corner with chalk of every shingle the Field Tech points out.\n Before you begin filming; take a before shot of the area where you will be extracting the shingle. Start recording, state the Home\ntab (if applicable) and mark the bottom right corner with chalk of every shingle the Field Tech points out.\n Before you begin filming; take a before shot of the area where you will be extracting the shingle. Start recording, state the Homeowners name and house number. “...Here we are at [HOMEOWNER’S HOUSE at 1234 (street name)] performing a repair attempt on this storm damaged shingle. As you can see I have pre-marked every tab that will sustain unavoidable creasing due to the brittleness of the roof. Go ahead and get started Francisco/Ishmael”\nFilm the entire area where repair is going to occur, then go from the Wide camera shot to a low down side view camera angle, to show how the shingles get bent back/pried up during the process. Make sure to show on camera or explicitly mention the high amount of granule loss running down the roof.\nOnce the new shingle has been installed, hover the camera over the shingles and wipe your hand back and forth gently or blow over the top of each tab that was pried up. Trace your finger along the crease and show it on camera, explain how each tab has now been mechanically creased and confirms the roof failed a “brittle test”. (picture below)\nOnce you have finished recording your video. Take close-up after pictures of the rows above the replaced shingle. Draw an arrow to where the crease is on the shingle or point to it for the picture.\n(see good examples of after pics below email template)\nTo whom it may concern,\nPlease see the attached video link and photos of the attempted repair for the claim number (#__________). \nAs can be clearly seen in the evidence provided, the homeowner's roof sustained additional damage during the attempted repairs. Thus confirming a failed brittle test for the shingles, indicating irreparability for the roof as a whole.\nWith this fact established, your current estimate does not adequately address the needs of this roof. Performing further patch repairs as [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME] has suggested will unintentionally, yet unavoidably, cause further extensive damage to surrounding shingles. Therefore I have gone ahead and attached an estimate that accurately reflects the full scope of work necessary to make our mutual client whole again. \nYouTube Link: https://youtu.be/Tx6km60KXhc?feature=shared (watch this for a good example)\nI also ask that you take note of the\nfull scope of work necessary to make our mutual client whole again. \nYouTube Link: https://youtu.be/Tx6km60KXhc?feature=shared (watch this for a good example)\nI also ask that you take note of the attached before and after pictures of the attempted repair. These photos clearly demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably do further unavoidable damage to surrounding shingles. \nPlease review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly, so we can begin to move forward with the full roof replacement for [HOMEOWNER NAME]. If we can provide any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out.\nThank you for your time and for working with us to assist [HOMEOWNER] in restoring their property effectively after the loss they have experienced.\n(your signature)\nBefore\nBefore\nBefore\nAfter\n(continue below)\nAfter\nAfter",

Non-Storm Damage\nWelcome to Roof-ER!\nMeet the Owner:\nMy name is Oliver Brown. I founded this company in 2019, not because I have a passion for roofing or because I was born into a family of contractors, but because I saw an opportunity. An opportunity to change the reputation of roofing companies and contractors as a whole. This is an industry that is known for lack of communication, poor workmanship, used car sales techniques and straight up deceit by companies who still write up quotes with a pen and paper. With a little bit of modern thinking, integrity and hard work we’ve been able to build a strong brand and reputation in a relatively short amount of time. From $2.5m in year one, as a one man sales team to $20m in 2023, we are one of the fastest growing roofing companies in the DMV. That growth has only been possible by attracting like minded people who are looking to change their lives and those around them… And we are just getting started! \nWe have ambitions of growing up and down the east coast and eventually becoming a national brand. To accomplish this we need to continue to add and develop hungry, competitive team members who are dedicated to the big picture but disciplined to execute on a day to day basis. \nWelcome to your new career!\nMy name is Reese Samala, Director of Sales, here at Roof-ER! I will be spending your first week here with you.  I am excited to see what you accomplish here with us.\nA quick introduction of who I am:\nI am a medically retired Infantryman in the Army.  I have held previous positions as an automotive technician, various sales roles, and also had my own government contracting business.\nI am excited about the opportunities we are creating here.  We are dynamically\nI am a medically retired Infantryman in the Army.

We are dynamically growing this business and need people like you who want to be part of that growth.  I will always be a resource that you can lean on.  You will hear me say this many times throughout your time here with us: My marker of success is being able to see other people achieve things that they have not been able to achieve previously. \nThank you and I am excited to see what you accomplish here!\nReese Samala\nMission and Values\nOur Mission:\nAt Roof-ER, our mission is to hold a fiduciary responsibility to our customers - plain and simple.

I will achieve tremendous levels of success. I have seen the success that others achieved by committing to this process - I WILL be part of that.\nInitial Pitch\n5 Non-negotiables with every pitch\nWho you are\nWho we are and what we do (Roof ER)\nMake it relatable\nWhat you’re there to do (an inspection)\nGo for the close (them agreeing to the inspection)\nKnock on door/ring doorbell \nAs they are opening the door, smile and wave. \n“Hi, how are you? My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that specializes in helping homeowners get their roof and/or siding replaced, paid for by their insurance!”  \nGeneric\n“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Maryland over the past few months that have done a lot of damage! \n“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof (and/or siding) replaced.”\nOR\nSpecific\n“Were you home for the storm we had in ___. Wait for answer\nIf yes “It was pretty crazy right?! Wait for answer \nIf no: “Oh no worries at all, we get that all the time.\nIf yes move on to next line\n“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof (and/or siding) replaced.”\n“While\ntime.\nIf yes move on to next line\n“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof (and/or siding) replaced.”\n“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do,  I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.\nGo in for a handshake. What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am (your name).  Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“I will give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection. (See Inspection and Post-Inspection Script for detailed next steps.)\nInspection - Ideal photo progression \n§Mailbox/House Number/§Overview of House\n§Front Elevation Collateral\n§Damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, siding\n§Right Elevation  Collateral\n§Damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, siding\n§Rear Elevation Collateral\n§Damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, siding\n§Left Elevation Collateral\n§Damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, siding\n§Roof Overview Collateral\n§Damage to roof metals and other collateral on the roof\n§Circle Hail Hits & Slash Wind Damage (close up of each)\n§Overview of majority of the damage chalked up\n§Pictures of granules in the gutters or at the bottom of downspouts \n§Entire inspection shouldn’t take any longer than 15-20 minutes.

Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is most important. It doesn’t  matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you don’t have enough damage-photos for  the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim.\n§Flashlight\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nKnock on the door \n“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. First I walked around the perimeter of the house  to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the roof.”  \nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story.  Think of us like lawyers and this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof and/or siding approved.”\n\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage (IF there were any wind damaged shingles or missing shingles say:) and  anything I have slashed means its wind damage. \nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is circular  in nature.   Even if this  damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these hail divots fill with water, freeze….,  when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance company is responsible and your policy covers this type of damage.” \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. \n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.  \nIf there was wind damage or missing shingles, say the following:\n\n“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have both shingles that are creased from the wind lifting them up and shingles that have completely been blown off.”\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles (if applicable)\n“This is very similar to damage to ________ home and/or the rest of the approvals we\nased from the wind lifting them up and shingles that have completely been blown off.”\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles (if applicable)\n“This is very similar to damage to ________ home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the area”.  \n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when your insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all the damage that I  just showed you.” \n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go get iPad \nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10  Minutes”?\nOnce you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled. \n“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system. Then we can give your  insurance company a call”. \nGather information from the homeowner:\nFull name\nAddress\nPhone Number  \nE-mail\nInsurance Company\n“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”! \nAfter you have collected all the information:\nAsk if they have the app or if they have the login to the website. \nIf not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO.  As you are writing or typing the information for the HO to use on the call, explain each part to them.\nAs much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call \nReference Claim Filing Information Sheet\nMove on to Contingency & Claim Authorization\nClaim Filing Information Sheet  \nYou should use this information to prep the HO – Use a blank note on your iPad\nHO: “I’d like to file a claim for hail [and wind] damage” (never only wind)\nInsurance: “What was damaged?”\nRoof\nDownspouts\nGutters\nWindow Wraps\nSiding\nEtc.\nDate of loss\nTime of storm (usually around 5pm)\nSize of hail (usually 1 – 1.5 inches)\nType of shingle and/or siding\nAny\nGutters\nWindow Wraps\nSiding\nEtc.\nDate of loss\nTime of storm (usually around 5pm)\nSize of hail (usually 1 – 1.5 inches)\nType of shingle and/or siding\nAny interior damage?\nIs the house livable?\nWas there any personal property damaged?\nDid they lose power?\nHave you selected a contractor?

Then we will send in a completion form once you sign off on the complete project.\nThat’s when the insurance company will release the remaining funds minus your deductible. So\nyour final payment will only be those funds plus your deductible.\n“Any questions so far, sir/ma’am?”\nAnswer any questions\n“Great!

If you do, I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest\nof the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will\nat least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m\ngonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your\nroof.\nyour\nroof.\nGo in for a handshake. What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am\n(your name). Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their\nanswer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I will give you a knock when I\nfinish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection.

First I walked around the perimeter of the\nhouse to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the\nroof.” Say this while going through through house number and overview photos\nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story. Think of us like lawyers\nand this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof (and\nsiding) approved.”\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage\n(IF there were any wind damaged shingles or missing shingles say:) and anything I have slashed\nmeans its wind damage.\nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is\ncircular in nature. Even if this damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these\nhail divots fill with water, freeze…., when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle\nwhich will eventually lead to leaks. That is why your insurance company is responsible and your\npolicy covers this type of damage.”\nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.\nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\nIf there was wind damage or missing shingles, say the following:\n“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have both shingles that are creased from the wind\nlifting them up and shingles that have completely been blown off.”\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles (if applicable)\nNow show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts\n“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be\nwhat’s protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your roof, it knocks out these granules which\nreduces the lifespan of your roof.”\n“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in\nthe area”.\n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s\nunfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when\nyour insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make\nsure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all\nthe damage that I just showed you.”\n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”!

It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. How’s it going?”\n“Great, well we just received the decision from the insurance company. We’re going to have to take\nsome steps to get this turned around. I have already submitted my photo report that demonstrates\nthe damage to your property and the need to replace your whole roof, so hopefully they review and\napprove that. Could you please reach out to the adjuster to see if they were able to review my\nreport?”\nAfter HO answers. “Thank you! During that call, please let them know that you disagree with their\ncurrent decision and would like to have your property reinspected if they are not able to update their\ncurrent decision to a full approval based on the photo report that I sent them.”\nIf there are some approved shingles:\n“So we will also be conducting an iTel and Repair Attempt.\n“An iTel is where we will take a shingle off your roof and send it in to get tested to verify that it is\ndiscontinued. Since it is discontinued, the only effective way to restore your property would be with\na full roof replacement.\n“At that time, I will also take a video of us removing and replacing that shingle. This Repair Attempt\nvideo will demonstrate to the insurance company that your roof is not repairable and therefore\nwould need to be fully replaced.\n“To get those scheduled, I will need you to sign these 2 documents allowing us to do that. When\nyou see the documents, it will have a cost attached, but don’t worry! Read the bold print and you will\nsee that you, as the homeowner, are never responsible for this cost.”\nSchedule a time to meet with the HO to sign or let them know you will be sending it out for eSign.\nTask the proper people for eSign, if necessary.\n“We will definitely be putting in the work to give you the highest chance of getting this turned\naround. I definitely believe your roof has the damage that warrants a full replacement.

Thank you, sir/ma’am, goodbye!”\nPost Adjuster Meeting Script\nThis is the conversation you will have with the HO after an adjuster meeting\nIf moving to Estimate Pending:\n“Great! The Adjuster/Ladder Assist identified all the same damage as me. You will be receiving an\nemail from us shortly saying that you’ve been fully approved. Within a few days you should receive\nthe itemized estimate from the Insurance Company. Once you receive that, you can forward that to\nme. This is going to include every line item that the insurance company believes is needed to make\nyou whole again. To you this is going to look like gibberish. But, don’t worry, that’s what we’re here\nfor. If for some weird reason the desk adjuster does not write it for a full approval after this\ninspection, I will take the steps necessary to get it turned around! Any questions on that,\nsir/ma’am?”\nAnswer any questions\n“When the insurance company generates their estimate, it will also typically trigger the release of\nthe first payment. The insurance company refers to this payment as the ACV. Which stands for\nActual Cash Value. That amount will be used as your down payment. The remaining funds are held\nby the insurance company until we complete the work. They refer to these remaining funds as\nDepreciation. Which is not “depreciation” as most would think about it, it’s just their way of holding\non to some of the funds to make sure the work gets done.\n“At the same time our office will be reviewing your entire project along with my photos and the\ninsurance estimate. As I’ve mentioned, insurance companies are always trying to save money. We\nusually find specific line items that are missing. Most commonly, code items like IWS and Drip\nEdge. We will supplement for all the items needed to complete your project to code and our\nmanufacturer’s specifications. Don’t worry, like we have agreed to from the beginning, we\nguarantee you that you would not have to cover any of these costs even if the insurance company\nwere to deny our supplement. [Which does not happen.]\n“Once our office has completed your job review, which takes 2 - 3 business days, your job will be\nassigned to one of our Project Coordinators. They will reach out to schedule a project meeting\nwhere they will walk you through all of the finer details. This is the fun\ntakes 2 - 3 business days, your job will be\nassigned to one of our Project Coordinators. They will reach out to schedule a project meeting\nwhere they will walk you through all of the finer details. This is the fun part where you will get to pick\nour products and colors. *Of course if you have anything else you would like us to do beyond the\ninsurance approval, your Project Coordinator could price that out for you.*\n“Your install date will typically be 4 - 6 weeks after your Project Meeting. After you submit that initial\npayment from the insurance company, we’ll reach out to get your project scheduled!\n“I know that was a lot of information. The most important thing from here is forwarding the estimate\nas soon as you get it. Of course if you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to\nreach out.\nAnswer any questions that they may have.\n“A great way for me to help assist some of your neighbors, would be if I could put up a yard sign!\nWould you mind if I put one up?

Use\nPost-AM-Email-Template if you need to.\nIf moving to Decision Pending:\n“So, we just finished our inspection. The Adjuster/Ladder Assist will be sending their report to a\ndesk adjuster and will be making a final decision. Once they make a decision, they will write up an\nitemized estimate and should send that over to you. Once you receive that, please forward that over\nto me. They can be a bit hard to read, so I’ll be able to walk through all of that with you.\n“If it comes back as anything other than a full approval, I’ll take the necessary steps to make sure it\ngets turned around! There are a lot of steps we can take from here, which we can go over once we\nreceive the estimate.\n“I will go over all this information again once we receive the estimate and have a more clear picture\nof what the next steps will be.”\nAnswer any questions they may have\n“Great! So, if you have any questions between now and when you get your estimate, please reach\nout!

The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that\namount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\nNon-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\nExample: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and\ndecides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\nImportant for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it —\nit can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.\nComplaint Forms\nHave HO use these websites to submit a complaint\nAllstate:\nNationwide:\nUnder “What is your Email About” Select “General Inquiries”\nUnder “What is the Subject of your Email” Select “Feedback & Complaints”\nState Farm:\nSelect “Other” on drop down menu, and then click the link that says “this form”\nErie:\nTravelers:\nIf you/HO already sent email(s) to\nUse this link to file a complaint:\nSelect “Give complaint or Share a concern” on the first drop down menu\nThen select “Your Experience” on the second drop down menu\nUnder the “relationship” drop down menu, HO should select “customer”\n(You shouldn’t fill this form out often, but if you do there is an option to select “3rd party)”\nFarmers Insurance:\nGrange:\nSelect “Your Claim/Claim Status” on drop down menu\nHomsite:\nEmail\nLiberty Mutual:\nMercury:\nProgressive:\nClick “Send Email” and then select “Your Claim/Claims Process” on drop down menu\nThe Philadelphia Contributionship:\nUniversal Property Complaint Form:\nSelect “Feedback” on the drop down menu\nUniversal Property Document Sharing:\nUse this link when you need to send information/documents to the assigned adjuster at Universal\nProperty\nYou can even write emails in a google docs, download the file, and upload it to ClaimPath as a\n“correspondence letter”\nThe Hartford:\nMake sure HO includes the Claim Number when filling out the complaint\nVirginia Farm Bureau:\nCumberland Mutual\nFill out contact form and make request by using the link\nNorthern Neck\nScroll to the bottom of the page and fill out form there\nAlso has generic email claimreport@nnins.com\nAssurant\nUnfortunately there is no complaint form online.

Then she pulled the ehh I'm seeing a pattern here that's not looking consistent with hail and then I was like are you serious? This is definitely hail and if you were to see the roof metals you wouldn't be doubting this and if it wasn't raining you wouldn't be doubting this. She was pretty difficult but none the less I'm not worried I know there's fire hail damage there and my photo report is great so just gotta get her when it's dry and show her some quality stuff and I'm sure she will buy. She will try to pull the whole \"wind driven\" thing with hail and you tell her NO hail is\nand my photo report is great so just gotta get her when it's dry and show her some quality stuff and I'm sure she will buy.

If additional inspection is required, I will gladly meet your adjuster on-site.\nThank you for your time and cooperation in restoring [CUSTOMER NAME]’s home.\n[Signature & Contact Info]\n4️⃣ Escalation if Denied Again\nHave homeowner send the “Customer to Insurance” template .\n\nIf still stuck, file complaint with Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) citing Bulletin 18-23 on mismatch claims .\n\nLast resort: consider arbitration .\n\n✅ End Result: You’ve hit them with\nPhoto evidence,\n\nManufacturer & iTel data,\n\nCode citations,\n\nHomeowner involvement,\n\nState insurance rules.\n\nThat’s the 5-layer defense that usually forces a scope revision.\n clear picture of your Roof-ER job stages, based on the training deck you uploaded .\nHere’s how they flow:\n🔹 \nJob Stages & Timeline\nLead Generation / Door Knocking\n\nGoal: 70 doors/day\n\nUse pitch script (storm vs non-storm)\n\nPin houses in Field Portal\n\nInspection\n\nWalk perimeter → note collateral damage (gutters, siding, downspouts, screens, etc.)\n\nGet roof overview + chalk wind/hail hits\n\nTake full photo set (portrait orientation for reports)\n\nSafety: Cougar Paws, pitch hopper, bungees, etc.\n\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n\nShow photos of collateral first → build the “case”\n\nThen show roof damage photos (hail = circles, wind = slashes)\n\nExplain long-term damage (granule loss, leaks, deterioration)\n\nPrep homeowner for claim filing\n\nClaim Filing & Authorization\n\nFile claim with HO (use HO’s phone\nshow roof damage photos (hail = circles, wind = slashes)\n\nExplain long-term damage (granule loss, leaks, deterioration)\n\nPrep homeowner for claim filing\n\nClaim Filing & Authorization\n\nFile claim with HO (use HO’s phone/app when possible)\n\nHave HO sign Contingency Agreement (Roof-ER gets the job if fully approved)\n\nHave HO sign Claim Authorization Form (allows you to communicate with insurance)\n\nAdjuster Meeting (AM)\n\nHappens 2–7 days after claim filed\n\nRep meets insurance adjuster on-site\n\nShow collateral + roof damage, ensure adjuster sees everything\n\nDOs: Show up early, chalk metals, build rapport, tactfully present case\n\nDON’Ts: Be confrontational, take over inspection, or miss the meeting\n\nInsurance Decision\n\nUsually 1–10 business days after AM\n\nOften partial or denial first time around\n\nRep must use templates (Photo Report, Repair Attempt, iTel, etc.) to push back\n\nProject Meeting\n\nOnce full approval obtained → send estimate to Amber (estimates@theroofdocs.com)\n\nJob assigned to Project Coordinator\n\nPC meets with HO, signs Project Docs, and collects Downpayment (ACV check)\n\n\nInstall Scheduling\n\nUsually 4–6 weeks after Downpayment\n\nCoordinated via Trade Calendar\n\nInstall & Wrap Up\n\nRoof installed\n\nQuality Check + Wrap Up with HO\n\nHO signs Certificate of Completion\n\nCertificate sent to insurance → triggers depreciation release\n\nFinal Payment\n\nHO pays deductible + depreciation funds\n\nRep receives remaining commission % (based on signups/volume)\n\nclear Job Stage Guide for Roof-ER.\nThis will tell you where jobs SHOULD be, and where they SHOULD NOT be at each point.\n🗂 Roof-ER Job Stages Guide\n1. \nLead / Knock\n✅ Job should be here when:\nYou’ve pinned a house in Field Portal\n\nNo inspection yet\n\n🚫 Job should NOT be moved forward until:\nHomeowner agrees to inspection\n\n2. \nInspection\n✅ Job should be here when:\nYou’ve completed the free inspection\n\nPhotos taken + damages chalked\n\nReady for post-inspection pitch\n\n🚫 Do NOT move to Claim until:\nHO agrees to file a claim\n\nContingency & Claim Authorization signed\n\n3. \nClaim Filed\n✅ Job should be here when:\nClaim filed with insurance (ideally on HO’s phone)\n\nClaim #

    "content": "Arbitration Information\nBinding Arbitration\nLegally enforceable like a court decision.\nBoth parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final.\nNo appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).\nOnce the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply — often enforced in court if needed.\nExample: An insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via\nbinding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that\namount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\nNon-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\nExample: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and\ndecides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\nImportant for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it —\nit can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.\nComplaint Forms\nHave HO use these websites to submit a complaint\nAllstate:\nNationwide:\nUnder “What is your Email About” Select “General Inquiries”\nUnder “What is the Subject of your Email” Select “Feedback & Complaints”\nState Farm:\nSelect “Other” on drop down menu, and then click the link that says “this form”\nErie:\nTravelers:\nIf you/HO already sent email(s) to\nUse this link to file a complaint:\nSelect “Give complaint or Share a concern” on the first drop down menu\nThen select “Your Experience” on the second drop down menu\nUnder the “relationship” drop down menu, HO should select “customer”\n(You shouldn’t fill this form out often, but if you do there is an option to select “3rd party)”\nFarmers Insurance:\nGrange:\nSelect “Your Claim/Claim Status” on drop down menu\nHomsite:\nEmail\nLiberty Mutual:\nMercury:\nProgressive:\nClick “Send Email” and then select “Your Claim/Claims Process” on drop down menu\nThe Philadelphia Contributionship:\nUniversal Property Complaint Form:\nSelect “Feedback” on the drop down menu\nUniversal Property Document Sharing:\nUse this link when you need to send information/documents to the assigned adjuster at Universal\nProperty\nYou can even write emails in a google docs, download the file, and upload it to ClaimPath as a\n“correspondence letter”\nThe Hartford:\nMake sure HO includes the Claim Number when filling out the complaint\nVirginia Farm Bureau:\nCumberland Mutual\nFill out contact form and make request by using the link\nNorthern Neck\nScroll to the bottom of the page and fill out form there\nAlso has generic email claimreport@nnins.com\nAssurant\nUnfortunately there is no complaint form online.

Of course, I’ll always keep you looped\nin with our communication by CCing you in all emails and updating you on any conversations we\nhave.\nThey sign\nPress Submit enter password “roofer” if it asks.\n“Alright, we are all set! Again, the most important part of this process is that I am here when the\ninsurance company comes out. Ideally you can have them call me to schedule that directly. If they\ncall me, great! But, regardless, please get the adjuster’s information (name, email, phone number)\nand send that over to me so that I can communicate with them before the inspection. If they insist\non scheduling with you, go ahead and pencil in a time and avoid these times and days [provide your\nschedule]\nAnswer any questions that the HO may have\n“Thank you, sir/ma’am, looking forward to seeing you on the day of inspection, you have my contact\ninformation on my card if you need anything else\ndays [provide your\nschedule]\nAnswer any questions that the HO may have\n“Thank you, sir/ma’am, looking forward to seeing you on the day of inspection, you have my contact\ninformation on my card if you need anything else.\nFull Approval Estimate Phone Call\nThis is the call you will make to your HO as soon as you receive the estimate\n“Hello sir/ma’am! It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. Congratulations, I am glad we were able to\nensure that your insurance company fully approved your roof/siding/gutters/etc replacement!\n“So the next steps are, as I mentioned last time we met:\n“One of our Project Coordinators will be reaching out to you to schedule a Project Meeting to go\nover your full scope of work.\n“Based on the estimate, your insurance company will be sending you [ACV AMOUNT] shortly. This\nwill be used as your down payment. With that, we can start all of your work! When they send you\nthat check, just hold on to it until your meeting with our Project Coordinator who will help with all the\nnext steps.\n“Our estimating team will also be sending in supplements to the insurance company based on items\nthey may have missed. This includes Code Items such as IWS and Drip Edge. And don’t worry!\nEven if for some reason they do not approve these amounts, we will still do all the necessary work\nand never charge you for it. As we talked about earlier, your only cost out of this will be your\ndeductible once we finish all the work.\n“Upon completion of the installation, we will review and inspect all of our work to ensure it is to your\nsatisfaction. Then we will send in a completion form once you sign off on the complete project.\nThat’s when the insurance company will release the remaining funds minus your deductible. So\nyour final payment will only be those funds plus your deductible.\n“Any questions so far, sir/ma’am?”\nAnswer any questions\n“Great! Again, I am glad that we were able to make this happen for you, now you get to experience\nthe quality that Roof ER always delivers, at only the cost of your deductible after your whole project\nis complete!” Potentially mention additional work that they may want to add.\nAnswer any additional questions or engage in any conversation the HO starts.\n“Also, if you know anyone else that I can help, have them reach out to me! You have my card - they\ncan call, text, or email me and I can inspect their property to see if they have the same qualifying\ndamage and I can walk them through the same process I have walked you\nthem reach out to me! You have my card - they\ncan call, text, or email me and I can inspect their property to see if they have the same qualifying\ndamage and I can walk them through the same process I have walked you through!\nEngage in any conversation that this starts\n“Awesome!\nIf you haven’t already put up a yard sign: “Would you mind if I put up a yard sign next time I’m in\nyour area? This will definitely help other companies already know that you’re working with someone\nand hopefully eliminate anyone else from knocking your door asking about your roof/siding.”\n“Look out for the communication from one of our Project Coordinators so you can get that Project\nMeeting scheduled to go over all the next steps and your full scope of work. Congratulations again\nand have a great day!”\nInitial Pitch\n5 Non-negotiables with every pitch\nWho you are\nWho we are and what we do (Roof ER)\nMake it relatable\nWhat you’re there to do (an inspection)\nGo for the close (them agreeing to the inspection)\nKnock on door/ring doorbell\nAs they are opening the door, smile and wave.\n“Hi, how are you? My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that\nspecializes in helping homeowners get their roof (and siding) replaced, paid for by their insurance!”\nGeneric:\n“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Philadelphia/Maryland over the past few\nmonths that have done a lot of damage!\n“We’re already working with your neighbors. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved\nthrough their insurance company to have their roof and/or siding replaced.”\n(Go to line marked with ^)\n-OR-\nSpecific\n“Were you home for the storm we had in ___. Wait for answer\nIf yes “It was pretty crazy right?! Wait for answer\nIf no: “Oh no worries at all, we get that all the time.\nIf yes move on to next line marked with *\nIf no “That’s good! It was a pretty bad one!”\n*“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully\napproved through their insurance company to have their roof (and siding) replaced.”\n^“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you\nhave similar, qualifiable damage. If you do, I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest\nof the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will\nat least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m\ngonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your\nroof.\nyour\nroof.\nGo in for a handshake. What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am\n(your name). Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their\nanswer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I will give you a knock when I\nfinish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection.

First I walked around the perimeter of the\nhouse to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the\nroof.” Say this while going through through house number and overview photos\nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story. Think of us like lawyers\nand this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof (and\nsiding) approved.”\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage\n(IF there were any wind damaged shingles or missing shingles say:) and anything I have slashed\nmeans its wind damage.\nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is\ncircular in nature. Even if this damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these\nhail divots fill with water, freeze…., when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle\nwhich will eventually lead to leaks. That is why your insurance company is responsible and your\npolicy covers this type of damage.”\nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.\nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\nIf there was wind damage or missing shingles, say the following:\n“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have both shingles that are creased from the wind\nlifting them up and shingles that have completely been blown off.”\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles (if applicable)\nNow show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts\n“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be\nwhat’s protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your roof, it knocks out these granules which\nreduces the lifespan of your roof.”\n“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in\nthe area”.\n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s\nunfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when\nyour insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make\nsure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all\nthe damage that I just showed you.”\n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go\nget iPad\nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we\njust showed you.”\n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go\nget iPad\nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10\nMinutes”?\nOnce you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled.\n“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system. Then we can let\nyour insurance company know about the damagel”.\nGather information from the homeowner:\nFull name\nAddress\nPhone Number\nE-mail\nInsurance Company\n“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”!\nAfter you have collected all the information:\nAsk if they have the app or if they have the login to the website.\nIf not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO.

It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. How’s it going?”\n“Great, well we just received the decision from the insurance company. We’re going to have to take\nsome steps to get this turned around. I have already submitted my photo report that demonstrates\nthe damage to your property and the need to replace your whole roof, so hopefully they review and\napprove that. Could you please reach out to the adjuster to see if they were able to review my\nreport?”\nAfter HO answers. “Thank you! During that call, please let them know that you disagree with their\ncurrent decision and would like to have your property reinspected if they are not able to update their\ncurrent decision to a full approval based on the photo report that I sent them.”\nIf there are some approved shingles:\n“So we will also be conducting an iTel and Repair Attempt.\n“An iTel is where we will take a shingle off your roof and send it in to get tested to verify that it is\ndiscontinued. Since it is discontinued, the only effective way to restore your property would be with\na full roof replacement.\n“At that time, I will also take a video of us removing and replacing that shingle. This Repair Attempt\nvideo will demonstrate to the insurance company that your roof is not repairable and therefore\nwould need to be fully replaced.\n“To get those scheduled, I will need you to sign these 2 documents allowing us to do that. When\nyou see the documents, it will have a cost attached, but don’t worry! Read the bold print and you will\nsee that you, as the homeowner, are never responsible for this cost.”\nSchedule a time to meet with the HO to sign or let them know you will be sending it out for eSign.\nTask the proper people for eSign, if necessary.\n“We will definitely be putting in the work to give you the highest chance of getting this turned\naround. I definitely believe your roof has the damage that warrants a full replacement. But, of\ncourse, insurance companies are billion dollar, publicly traded companies that will try to save as\nmuch money as they can on every claim. That is why it is great that you are working with us since\nwe know the proper steps to ensure that you\ncourse, insurance companies are billion dollar, publicly traded companies that will try to save as\nmuch money as they can on every claim. That is why it is great that you are working with us since\nwe know the proper steps to ensure that you are adequately taken care of by your insurance\ncompany!”\nAnswer any questions or concerns the HO has.\n“Alright, so let me know how the phone call goes with your adjuster and I’ll start working on my end\nto put everything together to get this turned around. Thank you, sir/ma’am, goodbye!”\nPost Adjuster Meeting Script\nThis is the conversation you will have with the HO after an adjuster meeting\nIf moving to Estimate Pending:\n“Great! The Adjuster/Ladder Assist identified all the same damage as me. You will be receiving an\nemail from us shortly saying that you’ve been fully approved. Within a few days you should receive\nthe itemized estimate from the Insurance Company. Once you receive that, you can forward that to\nme. This is going to include every line item that the insurance company believes is needed to make\nyou whole again. To you this is going to look like gibberish. But, don’t worry, that’s what we’re here\nfor. If for some weird reason the desk adjuster does not write it for a full approval after this\ninspection, I will take the steps necessary to get it turned around! Any questions on that,\nsir/ma’am?”\nAnswer any questions\n“When the insurance company generates their estimate, it will also typically trigger the release of\nthe first payment. The insurance company refers to this payment as the ACV. Which stands for\nActual Cash Value. That amount will be used as your down payment. The remaining funds are held\nby the insurance company until we complete the work. They refer to these remaining funds as\nDepreciation. Which is not “depreciation” as most would think about it, it’s just their way of holding\non to some of the funds to make sure the work gets done.\n“At the same time our office will be reviewing your entire project along with my photos and the\ninsurance estimate. As I’ve mentioned, insurance companies are always trying to save money. We\nusually find specific line items that are missing. Most commonly, code items like IWS and Drip\nEdge. We will supplement for all the items needed to complete your project to code and our\nmanufacturer’s specifications. Don’t worry, like we have agreed to from the beginning, we\nguarantee you that you would not have to cover any of these costs even if the insurance company\nwere to deny our supplement. [Which does not happen.]\n“Once our office has completed your job review, which takes 2 - 3 business days, your job will be\nassigned to one of our Project Coordinators. They will reach out to schedule a project meeting\nwhere they will walk you through all of the finer details. This is the fun\ntakes 2 - 3 business days, your job will be\nassigned to one of our Project Coordinators. They will reach out to schedule a project meeting\nwhere they will walk you through all of the finer details. This is the fun part where you will get to pick\nour products and colors. *Of course if you have anything else you would like us to do beyond the\ninsurance approval, your Project Coordinator could price that out for you.*\n“Your install date will typically be 4 - 6 weeks after your Project Meeting. After you submit that initial\npayment from the insurance company, we’ll reach out to get your project scheduled!\n“I know that was a lot of information. The most important thing from here is forwarding the estimate\nas soon as you get it. Of course if you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to\nreach out.\nAnswer any questions that they may have.\n“A great way for me to help assist some of your neighbors, would be if I could put up a yard sign!\nWould you mind if I put one up?

Use\nPost-AM-Email-Template if you need to.\nIf moving to Decision Pending:\n“So, we just finished our inspection. The Adjuster/Ladder Assist will be sending their report to a\ndesk adjuster and will be making a final decision. Once they make a decision, they will write up an\nitemized estimate and should send that over to you. Once you receive that, please forward that over\nto me. They can be a bit hard to read, so I’ll be able to walk through all of that with you.\n“If it comes back as anything other than a full approval, I’ll take the necessary steps to make sure it\ngets turned around! There are a lot of steps we can take from here, which we can go over once we\nreceive the estimate.\n“I will go over all this information again once we receive the estimate and have a more clear picture\nof what the next steps will be.”\nAnswer any questions they may have\n“Great! So, if you have any questions between now and when you get your estimate, please reach\nout! And, again, once you receive that from the insurance company, forward that over to me so I\ncan review that with you. Thank you sir/ma’am!

We appreciate your approval of the [approved slope], but respectfully must point out why full replacement is required for this roof system.\nManufacturer Requirements: Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, partial replacements compromise roof integrity and void manufacturer warranty.\n\nBuilding Code Compliance: [If applicable, system inserts state code reference — e.g., VA slope requirement, MD matching law.]\n\nMaterial Availability: The insured’s shingles are discontinued (see attached Discontinued Shingle List). Mixing product lines is prohibited per manufacturer.\n\nUniform Appearance: Industry standards (HAAG, NAIC) require uniformity — patching or partial replacement would result in a mismatched roof system.\n\nFor these reasons, we request full approval of all slopes. Supporting documentation and photos are attached for review.\nPlease confirm receipt and next steps.\nBest regards,\n[Rep Name]\nRoof-ER\n[Phone] | [Email]\nAttachments Auto-Added:\nPhoto Report (generated from app photos)\n\nGAF Storm Damage Guidelines.pdf\n\nDiscontinued Shingle List.pdf\n\nStep 3: Rep Actions\n✅ Quick preview/edit if needed.\n\n📤 Send directly from the app (or copy into Outlook/Gmail).\n\n🗂️ Email automatically saved in customer’s claim file.\n\n🔥 This means reps can go from “Adjuster denied partial” → ready-to-send professional rebuttal email in under 1 minute.",

[Their name] great\nto meet you, again I am (your name). Oh and by the way do you know\nwho your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great!

I\nwill give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”\n▪ Without any hesitation, move into inspection.

How thorough of an\ninspection you should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is\nmost important. It doesn’t matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you\ndon’t have enough damage-photos for the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim.\n▪ Flashlight\n▪ Knock on the door\n▪ “Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you.\nFirst I walked around the perimeter of the house to look\nfor collateral damage.

That is why your insurance\ncompany is responsible and your policy covers this type of\ndamage.”\n▪ Start slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\n▪ “As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.\n▪ Start slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\n▪ Now show them pictures of the granules in gutters and\ndownspouts\n▪ “As you can see here, granules have filled up your\ngutters. These granules are supposed to be what’s\nprotecting your home. When wind and hail hits your\nPost-Inspection\nroof, it knocks out these granules which reduces the\nlifespan of your roof.”\nPitch\n▪ Put phone away\n▪ “This is very similar to damage to ________’s home\nand/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the\narea”.\n▪ “With that being said, insurance companies are always\nlooking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate\nbut that’s how they make money. The most important\npart of this process is that when your insurance\ncompany comes out to run their inspection, we are here\nas storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get\na fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure\nPost-Inspection\nthey see all the damage that I just showed you.”\nPitch ▪ “What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my\niPad and we can get this process started”!

If not, no big deal at all”!\n▪ After you have collected all the information:\nPitch\n▪ Ask if they have the app or if they have the login to the website.\n▪ If not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO.

The Adjuster/Ladder Assist identified all the same damage as me.  You will be receiving an email from us shortly saying that you’ve been fully approved.  Within a few days you should receive the itemized estimate from the Insurance Company.  Once you receive that, you can forward that to me. This is going to include every line item that the insurance company believes is needed to make you whole again. To you this is going to look like gibberish. But, don’t worry, that’s what we’re here for. If for some weird reason the desk adjuster does not write it for a full approval after this inspection, I will take the steps necessary to get it turned around! Any questions on that, sir/ma’am?”\nAnswer any questions\n“When the insurance company generates their estimate, it will also typically trigger the release of the first payment. The insurance company refers to this payment as the ACV. Which stands for Actual Cash Value. That amount will be used as your down payment.  The remaining funds are held by the insurance company until we complete the work. They refer to these remaining funds as Depreciation. Which is not “depreciation” as most would think about it, it’s just their way of holding on to some of the funds to make sure the work gets done.\n“At the same time our office will be reviewing your entire project along with my photos and the insurance estimate. As I’ve mentioned, insurance companies are always trying to save money.  We usually find specific line items that are missing. Most commonly, code items like IWS and Drip Edge. We will supplement for all the items needed to complete your project to code and our manufacturer’s specifications. Don’t worry, like we have agreed to from the beginning, we guarantee you that you would not have to cover any of these costs even if the insurance company were to deny our supplement. [Which does not happen.]\n“Once our office has completed your job review, which takes 2 - 3 business days, your job will be assigned to one of our Project Coordinators.

It’s unfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when your insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get a fair shake.

Due to the brittleness of the roof in general, during the repair the two rows of shingles above the one we were attempting to replace sustained unavoidable mechanical creasing. These photos clearly demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably do further damage to surrounding shingles.\n1. These can be seen in the updated photo report under the \"Brittle Test\" section, and best shown in Photos:(___)\nOR\n2.

This damage is consistent with what has already been approved which leaves us and the homeowner unsure why these findings were left off of the estimate. [Additional details as needed]\nDiscontinued\nThis estimate is for a full siding replacement due to the existing siding being discontinued. Per the attached iTel report, there are no similar matches available and so our estimate accounts for all elevations of siding.\nThe current siding is discontinued.  The similar siding that is available would have to be special ordered and paint matched.  Because of those things, it would not be a cost-effective solution to restore [HOMEOWNER’s] siding.  The only way to effectively make them whole again would be with full siding replacement.\nCode/Housewrap\nPer building code, we are required to install a house wrap on exterior wall sheathing to prevent moisture from getting to the building envelope. Further, we are required to follow the manufacturer's installation instructions while applying the weather barrier. These instructions state we must overlap Housewrap 6\" over any outside corners. This would require us to remove the existing aluminum outside corner and detach the aluminum panels on the adjacent run that meet at that corner post. This is not only impractical, but also impossible without causing further damage to metal siding panels, as they will inevitably sustain damage during the removal process. Due to this\ncorner and detach the aluminum panels on the adjacent run that meet at that corner post. This is not only impractical, but also impossible without causing further damage to metal siding panels, as they will inevitably sustain damage during the removal process.

If the transfer takes place afterwards, the length of this warranty shall be reduced to the two-year period after the ownership changes. If\nthere is a defect during this two-year period, GAF’s reimbursement to the second owner will be based only on the reasonable cost of replacement shingles or applicable accessories, reduced\nby the amount of use that has been received from the shingles or applicable accessories from the date of installation through the date of claim.\nManufacturing Defects: What Is Covered/Sole and Exclusive Remedy\nGAF Warranty Company, LLC, a subsidiary of GAF, warrants that your GAF Roofing Shingles will remain free from manufacturing defects that adversely affect their performance during\nthe applicable Smart Choice® Protection Period or that cause leaks for the remainder of the applicable warranty term and that your GAF Accessory Products will remain free from\nmanufacturing defects that adversely affect their performance during the applicable warranty term. Note: Wind Warranty and Algae Warranty are covered separately below.\n(1) During the Smart Choice® Protection Period: GAF will pay you the full reasonable cost of labor to repair or re-cover any defective GAF Products (excluding non-GAF accessories,\nmetalwork, or flashing) and will provide replacement GAF Products or the reasonable cost of obtaining replacement GAF Products, at GAF’s option. GAF will not pay to tear off your GAF\nProducts, or to dispose of them.\n(2) After the Smart Choice® Protection Period: Labor will no longer be covered. GAF’s contribution to you will be based on either providing you with replacement GAF Products or, at\nGAF’s choice, reimbursing you for the reasonable cost of replacement GAF Products. The amount of replacement GAF Products or reimbursement provided to you will be reduced to reflect\nthe use you have received from your GAF Products.\nat\nGAF’s choice, reimbursing you for the reasonable cost of replacement GAF Products. The amount of replacement GAF Products or reimbursement provided to you will be reduced to reflect\nthe use you have received from your GAF Products. The amount of use will be calculated by dividing the number of months which have elapsed since installation to the date of claim by the\nnumber of months in the warranty term. For a Lifetime† warranty, the number of months in the warranty term is deemed to be 600 for years 11–40 of the warranty term. For years 41 and\nbeyond of a Lifetime† warranty, GAF’s contribution is 20%. For example, if you make a claim for Lifetime† Shingles installed on a single-family home after your shingles have been installed\nfor 25 years (300 months), GAF’s contribution will be reduced by 300/600 or 50%.\ncontinued on next page\nGAF Shingle & Accessory\nLimited Warranty\ncontinued from previous page\nWind Warranty: What Is Covered/Sole and Exclusive Remedy\nThis limited warranty is specifically conditioned on your shingles or ridge cap shingles being fastened and installed strictly in accordance with GAF’s application instructions. This\nlimited warranty does not apply to starter strip shingles. GAF warrants to you that your GAF shingles or ridge cap shingles will not fail to seal, blow off, or sustain damage from winds (in-\ncluding gusts) up to the applicable wind speed listed above after they should have sealed but did not due to a manufacturing defect. If your shingles or ridge cap shingles do fail to seal,\nblow off, or suffer wind damage, GAF will reimburse you for the reasonable costs of replacing the blown-off or damaged shingles or ridge cap shingles and hand-sealing any unsealed\nshingles or ridge cap shingles. Costs related to underlayment, metal work, and flashings are not included. GAF’s maximum liability under this paragraph is to reimburse you for the cost\nof hand-sealing all of the shingles and ridge cap shingles on your roof.\nNote: All self-sealing shingles and ridge cap shingles, including GAF’s, must be exposed to warm, sunny conditions for several days before they completely seal. Before sealing occurs,\nshingles and ridge cap shingles are vulnerable to blow-offs and wind damage. Shingles and ridge cap shingles installed in fall or winter may not seal until the following spring. Shingles\nor ridge cap shingles that are not exposed to direct sunlight or adequate surface temperatures or that are not fastened or installed properly may never seal. Failures to seal, blow-offs,\nand wind damage under these circumstances result from the nature of self-sealing shingles and ridge cap shingles, not a manufacturing defect, and are not covered under this limited\nwarranty.\nAlgae Warranty: What Is Covered/Sole and Exclusive Remedy\nThis limited warranty applies only to shingles, ridge cap shingles, and starter strip shingles sold in packages bearing the StainGuard Plus PRO™, StainGuard Plus™ or StainGuard®\nlogos. GAF warrants to you that blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) will not cause a pronounced discoloration of your StainGuard Plus PRO™-, StainGuard Plus™-, or\nStain\nGuard®\nlogos. GAF warrants to you that blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) will not cause a pronounced discoloration of your StainGuard Plus PRO™-, StainGuard Plus™-, or\nStainGuard®-labeled shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles for the warranty term listed above. If your StainGuard Plus PRO™-, StainGuard Plus™-, or StainGuard®-\nlabeled shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles exhibit a pronounced discoloration caused by blue-green algae during the Smart Choice® Protection Period listed above,\nGAF’s contribution will be either the reasonable cost of commercially cleaning your shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles or, at GAF’s sole option, replacing discolored\nshingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles. The maximum cost to GAF shall be the lesser of the original cost of the affected shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shin-\ngles or the cost to clean the affected shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles. During the remainder of the limited warranty period, GAF’s contribution to you will be reduced\nto reflect the amount of use you have received from your shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles since they were installed. The amount of use will be calculated by dividing\nthe number of months which have elapsed since installation to the date of claim by the number of months in the Algae Warranty term.\nNote: Preventing pronounced algae-related discoloration of your shingles, ridge cap shingles, and starter strip shingles is achieved through formulations or through unique blends of\ngranules.\nWhat Is Not Covered\nEven if your GAF Products were not properly installed according to GAF’s application instructions or to standard good roofing practices, this limited warranty remains in effect. However,\nGAF will NOT be liable for and this warranty does NOT apply to:\n(1) D amage resulting from anything other than an inherent manufacturing defect in the GAF Products, such as:\n(a) i mproper fastening of your shingles or accessories or application not in strict accordance with GAF’s printed application instructions, if the improper installation was the cause of\nthe damage.\n( b) s ettlement, movement, structural damage, or defects in the building, walls, foundation, or\naccessories or application not in strict accordance with GAF’s printed application instructions, if the improper installation was the cause of\nthe damage.\n( b) s ettlement, movement, structural damage, or defects in the building, walls, foundation, or the roof base over which the GAF Products were applied.\n(c) inadequate ventilation.\n(2) Damage resulting from causes beyond normal wear and tear, such as:\n(a) acts of nature, such as hail, fire, or winds (including gusts) over the applicable wind speed listed above.\n(b) i mpact of traffic on the roof or foreign objects, including damage caused by objects blown onto the roof by wind.\n(c) improper storage or handling of the GAF Products.\n(3) I ce damming, except for leaks in the area of your roof deck covered by a GAF Leak Barrier which are caused by a manufacturing defect in your GAF Leak Barrier.\n(4) S hading or variations in the color of your GAF Products or discoloration or contamination caused by fungus, mold, lichen, algae (except for blue-green algae if your shingles, ridge\ncap shingles, or starter strip shingles were labeled with the Stainguard Plus PRO™, StainGuard Plus™, or StainGuard® logos), or other contaminants, including that caused by organic\nmaterials on the roof.\n(5) L abor costs, except as specifically provided for above, disposal costs, tear-off costs, and costs related to underlayments (unless your claim involves a manufacturing defect in a GAF\nUnderlayment), metal work, and flashings.\n(6) Damage to the interior or exterior of the building, including, but not limited to, mold growth.\nOther Limitations Concerning Coverage\nDecisions as to the extent of repair, re-cover, or cleaning required, and the reasonable cost of such work, will be made solely by GAF. GAF reserves the right to arrange directly for your\nGAF Products to be repaired, re-covered, or cleaned instead of reimbursing you for such work. The remedy under this warranty is available only for that portion of your GAF Products\nactually exhibiting manufacturing defects or algae discoloration at the time your claim is settled. Any replacement GAF Products will be warranted only for the remainder of the original\nwarranty period. GAF reserves the right to discontinue or modify its shingles or accessories, including the\nalgae discoloration at the time your claim is settled. Any replacement GAF Products will be warranted only for the remainder of the original\nwarranty period. GAF reserves the right to discontinue or modify its shingles or accessories, including the colors available, so any replacement GAF Products may not be an exact match\nfor the GAF Products on your roof. Even if GAF does not modify a color, replacement GAF Products may not match your original GAF Products due to normal weathering, manufacturing\nvariations, or other factors. In the event that GAF is unable to provide replacement products, GAF reserves the right to provide the cash value of those replacement products.\nClaims: What You Must Do\nYou must notify GAF about any claim within 30 days after you notice a problem. You may report a claim online at gaf.com/contact, by calling GAF at 1-800-458-1860, sending an email\nto warrantyclaims@gaf.com, or by sending a notice in writing to: GAF, Warranty Claims Department, 1 Campus Drive, Parsippany, NJ 07054, USA. You will then be provided with com-\nplete details about submitting your claim. You will be required to provide proof of the date your shingles or accessories were installed and that you were the owner of the property at that\ntime (or that the warranty was properly transferred to you). You may be required to send to GAF, at your expense, photographs and sample products for testing. Within a reasonable time\nafter proper notification, GAF will evaluate your claim and resolve it in accordance with the terms of this limited warranty. If you repair or replace your GAF Products before you notify GAF\nabout your claim or before GAF has completed its evaluation of your claim, your claim may be denied. If you need to repair or replace your GAF Products before your claim is resolved,\nyou MUST provide GAF with reasonable notice. NOTE: Notice to your contractor, dealer, or home builder is NOT notice to GAF. You should retain this document for your records in\nthe unlikely event that you need to file a claim.\nSole and Exclusive Warranty\nTHIS LIMITED WARRANTY IS EXCLUSIVE AND REPLACES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY\nSTATUTE, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR\nLIMITED WARRANTY IS EXCLUSIVE AND REPLACES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY\nSTATUTE, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. This limited warranty is your exclusive warranty\nfrom GAF and represents the SOLE REMEDY available to any owner of GAF Shingles or Accessories. GAF makes NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, GUARANTEES, OR WARRAN-\nTIES of any kind other than that stated herein. GAF WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND,\nincluding DAMAGE TO THE INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR OF ANY BUILDING, whether any claim against it is based upon breach of this warranty, negligence, strict liability in tort, or for any other\ncause. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on\nor the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. New Jersey state residents are encouraged to review their rights\nunder the agreement, as provided under the New Jersey Truth-In-Consumer Contract Warranty and Notice Act (“TCCWNA”).\nThe United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall NOT apply either to the sale of the GAF Products or to this limited warranty.\nModification Of Warranty\nThis limited warranty may not be changed or modified except in writing, signed by an officer of GAF. No one (other than an officer of GAF) has the authority to assume any additional or\nother liability or responsibility for GAF in connection with your GAF Products except as described in this limited warranty.

    "content": "What is a homeowners deductible?\n- A homeowners insurance deductible is the amount a homeowner\nmust pay out of pocket before their insurance coverage applies.\nWhen a claim is approved, the insurance company will cover the\ntotal damage cost minus the deductible amount.\n- The terminology can be confusing, it may be helpful to think of it as\na copay, like when you go to the doctor.\n- It is important to note that if a deductible is not paid, there can be\nlegal consequences and any deprecation and/or PWI will be\nforfeited.\nTo whom is the deductible paid to?\n- You don’t pay your deductible directly to the insurance company\nlike a bill. Instead, it’s deducted from your claim payout. You'll\ncover the remaining amount—your deductible—when paying the\ncontractor or company repairing the damage.\nPer-Claim Basis:\n- It is important to note that homeowners insurance deductibles\ndiFer from health insurance deductibles in that they are paid on a\nper-claim basis (per event), whereas a health insurance deductible\nhas a maximum annual out of pocket.\nLet’s Run Two Examples:\n- In the first example, let’s say your deductible is $2,000 and you file\na claim for storm damage to your roof. The insurance company\nthen approves the work for $20,000. The insurance writes the\nestimate, subtracts the deductible, and pays out $18,000 while the\nremaining $2,000 (your deductible) is paid to the contractor.\n- Now let’s suppose your deductible is $1,000, and you file a claim\nfor storm damage to your gutters. The insurance company\napproves the claim and estimates the repair cost at $900. Since the\nrepair cost is less than your deductible, you’ll be responsible for\ncovering the full amount.\nHere’s what insurance companies and reporting agencies say:\n• Allstate\n• Travelers\n• Rocket Mortgage\n• USAA\n• State Farm\n• Forbes\n• Policygenius\nInsurance Claim Example (USAA):",

For any other type of owner or building, such as a\ncorporation, governmental entity, religious entity, condominium or homeowner association, school, apartment building, office building, or multi-use structure, the length of the warranty is 40 years and the non-prorated period is 20 years.\n** Smart Choice® Protection Period: refers to the crucial period of time following installation of the GAF Products during which the coverage provided for in this limited warranty is non-prorated. After the Smart Choice® Protection Period\nspecified above, the remedy provided for in this warranty may be different than that provided for during the Smart Choice® Protection Period, and any remedy will be reduced to reflect the use you have received from your GAF Products. The\namount of use will be calculated by dividing the number of months which have elapsed since installation to the date of claim by the number of months in the warranty term. For a Lifetime warranty, GAF’s contribution in years 51 and beyond is\n20%. After the non-prorated period, GAF’s maximum liability for any roof shall NOT exceed three times the reasonable cost of replacement GAF Products before any reduction for use.\n*** WindProven™ Limited Wind Warranty requires installation of LayerLock-labeled shingles using 4 nails per shingle, and at least four (4) qualifying accessories.\n****S pecial Installation: Your GAF LayerLock-labeled shingles will be covered up to the maximum wind speed above ONLY if installed using 4 nails per shingle and you have GAF Starter Strip Products installed at the eaves and rakes.

If the transfer takes place afterwards, the length of this warranty shall be reduced to the two-year period after the ownership changes.\nDuring this two-year period, GAF’s reimbursement to the second owner will be based only on the reasonable cost of replacement GAF Products, reduced by the amount of use that has been\nreceived from the GAF Products from date of installation through the date of claim.\nManufacturing Defects: What Is Covered/Sole And Exclusive Remedy\nGAF Warranty Company, LLC, a subsidiary of GAF, warrants that your GAF Products will remain free from manufacturing defects that adversely affect their performance during the applicable\nwarranty term listed above.

For installations which do not meet these eligibility requirements, see Wind Warranty section below. The\nlimited warranty applies only to your LayerLock-labeled shingles and does not apply to any GAF Accessory Products. GAF warrants to you that your LayerLock-labeled shingles will not fail\nto seal, blow off, or sustain damage from winds (including gusts) after they should have sealed but did not due to a manufacturing defect. If your LayerLock-labeled shingles do fail to seal,\nblow off, or suffer wind damage, GAF will reimburse you for the reasonable costs of replacing the blown-off or damaged shingles and hand-sealing any unsealed shingles. Costs related\nto underlayment, metal work, and flashings are not included. GAF’s maximum liability under this paragraph is to reimburse you for the cost of hand-sealing all of the LayerLock-labeled\nshingles on your roof.\nWind Warranty: What Is Covered/Sole And Exclusive Remedy\nGAF warrants to you that your GAF shingles and ridge cap shingles will not fail to seal, blow off, or sustain damage from winds (including gusts) up to the applicable wind speed listed above\nafter they should have sealed but did not due to a manufacturing defect or their misapplication.

E\nAlgae Warranty: What Is Covered/Sole And Exclusive Remedy\nThis limited warranty applies only to shingles and ridge cap shingles sold in packages bearing the StainGuard Plus™ or StainGuard® logos. GAF warrants to you that blue-green algae (also\nknown as cyanobacteria) will not cause a pronounced discoloration of your StainGuard Plus™- or StainGuard®-labeled shingles or ridge cap shingles for the warranty term listed above.\nIf your StainGuard Plus™-labeled shingles or your StainGuard®-labeled shingles or ridge cap shingles exhibit a pronounced discoloration caused by blue-green algae during the Smart\nChoice® Protection Period listed above, GAF’s contribution will be either the reasonable cost of commercially cleaning your shingles or ridge cap shingles or, at GAF’s sole option, replacing\ndiscolored shingles or ridge cap shingles. The maximum cost to GAF shall be the lesser of the original cost of the affected shingles or ridge cap shingles or the cost to clean the affected\nshingles or ridge cap shingles. During the remainder of the limited warranty period, GAF’s contribution to you will be reduced to reflect the amount of use you have received from your\nshingles or ridge cap shingles since they were installed. The amount of use will be calculated by dividinLg the number of months which have elapsed since installation to the date of claim by\nthe number of months in the Algae Warranty term.\nNote: Preventing pronounced algae-related discoloration of your shingles or ridge cap shingles is achieved through formulations or through unique blends of granules.\nMisapplication: What Is Covered/Sole And Exclusive Remedy\nIf any of your GAF Products or Covered Flashings is found to have an application error that adversely affects performance, GAF will arrange to have your roof repaired or re-covered or, at its\nsole option, will provide you with replacement GAF product(s) and reimburse you for the full reasonable cost of labor and other materials to repair or re-cover your roof, including Covered\nFlashings.

In the event that GAF determines your Master Elite® Roofing Contractor is unable or unwilling to perform these repairs,\nGAF will arrange to have your roof repaired if the issues were caused by application errors within the scope of GAF liability under this limited warranty.\nNote: Failure to install adequate ventilation is NOT an application error of your GAF Products and is not covered under this Limited Warranty.

    "content": "Arbitration Information\n Binding Arbitration\nLegally enforceable like a court decision.\nBoth parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final.\nNo appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).\nOnce the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply — often enforced in court if needed.\n Example:\nAn insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via binding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that amount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\n Non-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\n Example:\nThe arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and decides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\n Important for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it — it can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.",

An additional\nbenefit to complete replacement is the ability of the roofing professional to check for latent damage –\nsomething that is difficult to do if just a few shingles are replaced.

Governor Deputy Commissioner\n200 St. Paul Place, Suite 2700, Baltimore, Maryland 21202\n1-800-492-6116 TTY: 1-800-735-2258\nwww.insurance.maryland.gov\nBulletin 18-23\nDate: October 30, 2018\nTo: Property & Casualty Insurers\nRe: Clarification of Bulletin No. 97-1: Coverage of Aluminum Siding Claims,\nIncluding Claims for Mismatch\n*************************************************************************************\nThe purpose of this Bulletin is to update Bulletin No. 97-1 to take into consideration\npolicy language that was not in existence at that time concerning an insurer’s obligation for a\nclaim to replace damaged aluminum siding, which results in a mismatch in color shade, texture,\nor dimension.\nIn 1997, the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) issued Bulletin No. 97-1\nregarding claims to replace aluminum siding due to damage caused by a covered peril under a\n“replacement cost” homeowners insurance policy. The Bulletin noted that replacement of\ndamaged siding with new siding may result in a mismatch between existing siding and newly\ninstalled siding due to color shade, texture or dimension. Bulletin No. 97-1 advised that if a\nmismatch occurs, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other less visible\nareas of the house to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged\nsiding on one or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or a monetary allowance to\nreflect diminution in value of the house caused by mismatch. Bulletin No. 97-1 also noted that\nthe law does not require a replacement cost policy to ensure in every instance the replacement of\nall siding, including undamaged siding, in order to eliminate or minimize mismatching. At the\nsame time, the MIA advised that insurers whose settlement practices failed to take into account\nmajor differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions would be subject to\nadministrative action under Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, which has been recodified as\npresent Title 27, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article.\nAt the time MIA Bulletin No. 97-1 was issued, policy\n230A, Article 48A of the Code, which has been recodified as\npresent Title 27, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article.\nAt the time MIA Bulletin No. 97-1 was issued, policy language typically provided\ncoverage for direct physical damage not otherwise excluded in the policy. Since the issuance of\nBulletin 97-1 in 1997, however, most insurance policies now contain policy language\nspecifically excluding mismatch claims. Terms, conditions and exclusions with respect to\nmismatch vary among insurers and policies. Moreover, the specific language of the individual\ninsurance policy governs the rights, duties and obligations of the insurer and the policyholder.\nIn the absence of specific policy exclusion for mismatch claims, the advice contained in\nBulletin 97-1 still applies. Mismatch exclusions may apply to aluminum siding claims as well as\nother exterior finish materials such as roofing.\nWhile most policies now contain a specific exclusion for mismatch claims, some insurers\nalso offer optional coverage for mismatch claims. This coverage is not generally automatically\nincluded within a homeowners policy, but may be purchased at an additional cost. The terms,\nconditions and cost of such optional mismatch coverage vary among insurers and policies. To\nfind out whether your insurer offers additional coverage for mismatch claims, Maryland\nconsumers are encouraged to contact their producer or insurer for further information.\nFor questions regarding this Bulletin or for further information, please contact the\nMaryland Insurance Administration at 410-468-2000 or 800-492-6116.\nAl Redmer, Jr.\nCommissioner\nsignature on original\nBy: _____\nJoy Hatchette\nAssociate Commissioner\nConsumer Education and Advocacy",

    "content": "Aluminum Siding Claims\nMIA BULLETIN NO. 97-1\nThe Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) has received numerous complaints\nfrom homeowners concerning the settlement practices of insurers of claims for damage to\naluminum siding from hail. These complaints allege practices by insurers of paying to\nreplace only those portions of siding that are physically damaged without regard to the\nmismatching between existing and new siding. Failure to adjust such claims in accordance\nwith policy provisions or the company’s own operations or settlement guidelines may result\nin a finding that the insurer is in violation of Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code. This\nBulletin reiterates long-standing MIA policy regarding the settlement of such claims.\nThe MIA interprets Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, in the following manner\nas to claims for aluminum siding damage under a covered peril made under a “replacement\ncost” homeowner’s policy. The replacement of damaged siding with new siding may result in\nmismatched siding between the existing siding and the newly replaced siding. In such cases\nof mismatching, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other areas of the\nhouse to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged siding on\none or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or an allowance to reflect\ndiminution in value of the house caused by the mismatch. While the MIA does not interpret a\nreplacement cost policy to require in every instance, replacement of all siding including\nundamaged siding in order to minimize mismatching, insurers whose settlement practices fail\nto take into account major differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions as\nprovided above may be subject to action under Section 230A.\nInsurers should inform their insureds of any appraisal rights under the policy where\nthere is disagreement on the amount of a covered loss.

    "content": "GAF Manufacturer Guidelines & Storm Standards (Q201–Q225)\nQ201: Carrier says: \n“Shingle creases aren’t functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms creased shingles lose sealant and can’t be repaired .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated shingle creases are not functional damage. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, creasing causes the sealant strip to fail, reducing wind resistance and making repairs impossible. These shingles must be replaced .\nQ202: Adjuster says: \n“Sealant strips can be resealed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nResealing isn’t manufacturer-approved; GAF requires replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed resealing shingles. Per GAF guidelines, resealing is not an approved repair. Once a sealant strip fails, replacement is required to maintain warranty and performance .\nQ203: Carrier says: \n“Granule loss is cosmetic only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms granule loss exposes asphalt mat, accelerating failure .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed granule loss as cosmetic. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granules protect shingles from UV and weather. Loss exposes the asphalt mat, accelerates aging, and voids warranty. Replacement is required .\nQ204: Adjuster says: \n“Bruises don’t affect roof function.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBruising cracks asphalt mat, weakening waterproofing .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed hail bruises. Per GAF, hail bruising fractures the asphalt mat and loosens granules, weakening waterproofing. This constitutes functional damage requiring replacement .\nQ205: Carrier says: \n“Missing shingles can be spot repaired.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires full slope replacement if shingles are discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said missing shingles can be spot repaired. If the shingles are discontinued, per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, full slope replacement is required. Repairs with mismatched shingles are not permitted .\nQ206: Homeowner asks: \n“Why does manufacturer guideline matter to my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nManufacturer requirements protect warranty and system integrity .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nManufacturer guidelines are critical because\nshingles are not permitted .\nQ206: Homeowner asks: \n“Why does manufacturer guideline matter to my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nManufacturer requirements protect warranty and system integrity .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nManufacturer guidelines are critical because they define what’s required for your roof to perform properly and remain under warranty. Carriers must follow these guidelines when approving claims .\nQ207: Adjuster says: \n“Sealant damage isn’t visible, so not covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSealant failure is latent damage GAF recognizes as functional .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied coverage due to lack of visible sealant failure. Per GAF guidelines, latent sealant bond failure is recognized as functional damage that shortens roof life. Coverage must include replacement .\nQ208: Carrier says: \n“Manufacturer guidelines are just recommendations.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThey are enforceable requirements for maintaining warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed manufacturer guidelines as optional. Per GAF, installation and repair standards are enforceable warranty requirements. Ignoring them voids warranty and fails to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ209: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens if insurance ignores GAF guidelines?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIgnoring voids warranty and leaves roof noncompliant .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf insurance ignores GAF guidelines, your roof warranty is voided and your home is left noncompliant. That means future issues won’t be covered by the manufacturer. This is why guidelines must be followed in your claim .\nQ210: Adjuster says: \n“Wind-damaged shingles can be resealed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms resealing creased shingles is not permitted .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested resealing wind-creased shingles. Per GAF guidelines, resealing is not an approved repair method. These shingles have compromised integrity and require replacement .\nQ211: Carrier says: \n“Wind lift without missing shingles isn’t damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWind lift breaks sealant and weakens shingle bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said wind lift isn’t damage. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, uplift breaks the sealant strip and reduces resistance to future storms. These shingles are\nens shingle bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said wind lift isn’t damage. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, uplift breaks the sealant strip and reduces resistance to future storms. These shingles are damaged and require replacement .\nQ212: Homeowner asks: \n“Why does wind damage matter if roof isn’t leaking?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWind damage reduces wind resistance and voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nEven if your roof isn’t leaking, wind damage matters. It reduces wind resistance and voids your manufacturer warranty. Per GAF guidelines, wind-lifted or creased shingles must be replaced .\nQ213: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for slope replacement if only part is damaged.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires full slope replacement if shingles are discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied slope replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, when shingles are discontinued, the entire slope must be replaced to maintain warranty. Partial slope repairs are not acceptable .\nQ214: Adjuster says: \n“Ridge cap can be reused.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge caps must be replaced when removed .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said ridge caps can be reused. Per GAF, ridge caps must be replaced when slopes are replaced. Reusing voids warranty and fails to meet manufacturer standards .\nQ215: Carrier says: \n“Starter shingles aren’t required.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires starter strips at eaves/rakes for wind warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied starter shingles. Per GAF, starter strips at eaves and rakes are required for wind-resistance warranty. They cannot be omitted from scope .\nQ216: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just replace half my slope?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHalf-slope replacement voids GAF warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nReplacing only part of a slope voids warranty because of mismatched shingles and improper sealing. Per GAF requirements, slopes must be replaced in full to maintain integrity .\nQ217: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for underlayment replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires new underlayment during reroofing .\nDetailed\nrequirements, slopes must be replaced in full to maintain integrity .\nQ217: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for underlayment replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires new underlayment during reroofing .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied underlayment replacement. Per GAF slope requirements, underlayment must be replaced during reroofing. Reusing voids warranty and leaves roof noncompliant .\nQ218: Carrier says: \n“We don’t cover ventilation.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nProper ventilation required by GAF for warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied ventilation. Per GAF guidelines, balanced ventilation is required for warranty coverage. Omission voids manufacturer protection. Ventilation must be included .\nQ219: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is ventilation important for my roof?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt prevents heat/moisture buildup and extends roof life .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nVentilation prevents heat and moisture buildup in the attic, extending shingle life and preventing mold. Per GAF guidelines, it’s required for performance and warranty protection .\nQ220: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for hip/ridge shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires hip/ridge replacement when slopes replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded hip/ridge shingles. Per GAF slope replacement requirements, hip and ridge shingles must be replaced along with slopes. Reuse is not permitted .\nQ221: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for ice/water barrier.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIce barrier required by code and manufacturer in dam regions .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied ice/water barrier. Per IRC (as adopted in Virginia) and GAF guidelines, an ice barrier must be installed in eave areas prone to ice dams. This is not optional .\nQ222: Homeowner asks: \n“What if insurance refuses to follow GAF rules?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIgnoring GAF voids warranty and leaves roof noncompliant .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf insurance refuses to follow GAF rules, your roof will not qualify for manufacturer warranty. This leaves your property unprotected. Claims must align with manufacturer requirements .\nQ223: Adjuster says: \n“\nnoncompliant .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf insurance refuses to follow GAF rules, your roof will not qualify for manufacturer warranty. This leaves your property unprotected. Claims must align with manufacturer requirements .\nQ223: Adjuster says: \n“Manufacturer guidelines don’t control claims.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThey control warranty and installation — both apply to claims .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated guidelines don’t apply to claims. Manufacturer requirements control warranty validity and installation standards. Carriers must meet both to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ224: Carrier says: \n“Cosmetic storm damage isn’t covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage like granule loss, creasing, bruises = functional per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed storm damage as cosmetic. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, impacts like granule loss, creases, and bruises are functional damages that accelerate failure. Coverage must apply .\nQ225: Homeowner asks: \n“How do you prove damage to insurance?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThrough repair attempts, iTel reports, photo reports, and GAF standards .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe prove damage with multiple forms of evidence: repair attempts showing irreparability, iTel reports confirming discontinuation, photo reports documenting impacts, and GAF standards validating functional damage. Together, these establish the claim .\nQ226: Carrier says: \n“Half-slope repairs are acceptable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires full-slope replacement; half-slope repairs void warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated half-slope repairs are acceptable. Per GAF slope replacement requirements, partial slope repairs create mismatches and void warranty. Full slope replacement is required to comply with manufacturer standards .\nQ227: Adjuster says: \n“Warranty doesn’t affect insurance.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWarranty void leaves property below pre-loss condition .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed warranty impact. A roof without warranty is not restored to pre-loss condition. Per GAF, storm-damaged or improperly repaired shingles void warranty. Insurance must cover replacement .\nQ228: Carrier says: \n“We’ll patch with whatever’s available.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing products violates GAF system requirements .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern\ningles void warranty. Insurance must cover replacement .\nQ228: Carrier says: \n“We’ll patch with whatever’s available.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing products violates GAF system requirements .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed patching with non-matching products. Per GAF, roofing is a system — mixing products voids warranty and fails to restore performance. Replacement with matching materials is required .\nQ229: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t we just replace a few shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nReplacement voids warranty if shingles don’t match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nReplacing just a few shingles leaves mismatches and voids warranty. Per GAF slope replacement requirements, entire slopes must be replaced when repairs are not possible with matching materials .\nQ230: Adjuster says: \n“Granule loss isn’t functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGranule loss exposes asphalt, accelerating roof failure .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said granule loss isn’t functional. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granule loss exposes asphalt, accelerates UV degradation, and reduces roof life. This is functional damage requiring replacement .\nQ231: Carrier says: \n“Mat fractures aren’t visible.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMat fractures weaken waterproofing even if hidden .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed mat fractures as invisible. Per GAF, hail and wind fractures weaken the waterproofing mat beneath granules, shortening service life. Even if not visible from the surface, they are functional damage .\nQ232: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is matching important?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMismatch voids warranty and lowers property value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nMatching is important because mismatched shingles void manufacturer warranty and lower property value. Per GAF slope replacement rules, repairs must restore full slope with matching products .\nQ233: Adjuster says: \n“Only leaks prove damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms non-leaking storm damage is still functional .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said only leaks prove damage. Per GAF, wind creases, sealant failures, and bruises are functional damage even if no leak is present. Waiting for leaks ignores real, documented storm damage .\nQ234: Carrier says: \n“Rep\n’ve said only leaks prove damage. Per GAF, wind creases, sealant failures, and bruises are functional damage even if no leak is present. Waiting for leaks ignores real, documented storm damage .\nQ234: Carrier says: \n“Repairs are cheaper than replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepairs with discontinued shingles aren’t feasible; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said repairs are cheaper. Repairs with discontinued shingles are not feasible, and per GAF slope requirements, full replacement is the only code- and warranty-compliant option .\nQ235: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is manufacturer warranty important?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWarranty ensures long-term protection; ignoring voids it .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nManufacturer warranties protect you against defects and premature failures. If guidelines aren’t followed, the warranty is voided, leaving you unprotected. That’s why following GAF guidelines in claims is essential .\nQ236: Adjuster says: \n“Sealant bond failure isn’t covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms failed sealant is functional storm damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded sealant bond failures. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, broken sealant strips reduce wind resistance and shorten roof life. This constitutes functional storm damage requiring replacement .\nQ237: Carrier says: \n“Manufacturer guidelines aren’t law.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThey’re binding warranty requirements homeowners rely on .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said manufacturer guidelines aren’t law. While not legislation, they are binding warranty requirements. Failure to follow them voids warranty and leaves the roof noncompliant with industry standards .\nQ238: Homeowner asks: \n“What if insurance pays for repairs only?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPartial repairs violate GAF standards; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf insurance only pays for repairs, it leaves your roof below GAF standards and voids warranty. Per GAF slope replacement rules, repairs with discontinued products are not valid. Replacement is required .\nQ239: Adjuster says: \n“Manufacturer rules are optional.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThey’re mandatory for performance and warranty coverage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said manufacturer rules are optional. Per GAF, they are mandatory for performance and warranty\nrules are optional.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThey’re mandatory for performance and warranty coverage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said manufacturer rules are optional. Per GAF, they are mandatory for performance and warranty coverage. Ignoring them leaves the property below pre-loss condition .\nQ240: Carrier says: \n“Your report overstates manufacturer rules.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe cite directly from GAF documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our report exaggerates requirements. All citations are taken directly from GAF manufacturer guidelines and warranty provisions. These rules are not optional and must be followed .\nQ241: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens if warranty is voided?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nYou lose protection against defects and failures .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf warranty is voided, you lose protection against premature failures or defects. Per GAF, ignoring replacement rules voids coverage and leaves all future costs on the homeowner .\nQ242: Adjuster says: \n“Manufacturer won’t enforce warranty anyway.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF enforces warranty based on documented compliance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve claimed manufacturers won’t enforce warranty. Per GAF, warranty claims are only honored if installation and repair standards are followed. Ignoring standards makes coverage void .\nQ243: Carrier says: \n“We only cover visible damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLatent damage like sealant failure and mat fractures are functional .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied latent storm damage. Per GAF, sealant bond failures and mat fractures are recognized functional damages, even when not visible to the naked eye .\nQ244: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is latent damage important?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLatent damage shortens roof life and voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nLatent storm damage — like hidden fractures or bond failures — shortens roof lifespan and voids warranty. GAF guidelines recognize these as functional damages requiring replacement .\nQ245: Adjuster says: \n“Wind nicks aren’t significant damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven small wind damage compromises performance per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve minimized wind nicks. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small tears, creases, or\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven small wind damage compromises performance per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve minimized wind nicks. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small tears, creases, or nicks compromise wind resistance and accelerate failure. These damages are functional .\nQ246: Carrier says: \n“Warranty terms don’t apply to claims.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWarranty defines what’s required for proper replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said warranty terms don’t apply. Warranty requirements define what’s necessary for a compliant replacement. Insurance must meet these standards to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ247: Homeowner asks: \n“What if insurance ignores hidden damage?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIgnoring leaves roof compromised; GAF says latent damage matters .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf hidden storm damage is ignored, your roof remains compromised and warranty void. Per GAF guidelines, latent damage is functional and must be addressed .\nQ248: Adjuster says: \n“Manufacturer rules don’t bind us.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThey bind warranty, which is part of restoring pre-loss condition .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve claimed manufacturer rules don’t bind your estimate. They bind warranty validity, which is part of restoring pre-loss condition. A roof without warranty is not properly restored .\nQ249: Carrier says: \n“Warranty void doesn’t matter.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWarranty loss leaves homeowner with no protection .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed warranty loss. A roof without warranty leaves the homeowner unprotected from defects and premature failures. Per GAF guidelines, compliance is required to maintain protection .\nQ250: Homeowner asks: \n“Why should my roof follow manufacturer rules if insurance resists?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFollowing rules ensures durability, compliance, and protection .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nManufacturer rules must be followed because they ensure roof durability, code compliance, and warranty protection. Even if insurance resists, documentation citing GAF guidelines forces compliance .\nQ251: Carrier says: \n“Hail didn’t cause functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms hail causes fractures, bruising, and granule loss .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied hail damage as functional. Per GAF\ndidn’t cause functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms hail causes fractures, bruising, and granule loss .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied hail damage as functional. Per GAF guidelines, hail impact causes fractures, mat bruising, and granule loss. These reduce roof life and warranty coverage. Replacement is required .\nQ252: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see hail strikes in the field.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral confirms storm; field strikes visible in report .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied hail strikes in the field. Our photo report shows collateral impacts on gutters and metals, confirming storm activity. Per GAF, collateral plus bruised shingles establish functional hail damage .\nQ253: Carrier says: \n“Wind lift isn’t permanent damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWind lift breaks sealant, leaving shingles unbonded .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed wind lift as non-damage. Per GAF guidelines, lifted shingles break the sealant bond, reducing wind resistance permanently. This is functional storm damage .\nQ254: Adjuster says: \n“We only replace missing shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCreases, tears, and uplifts are also functional damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve limited scope to missing shingles. Per GAF, wind creases, tears, and uplifted shingles are functional damage. They require replacement along with missing tabs .\nQ255: Carrier says: \n“Collateral dents don’t matter.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral proves storm event and supports roof damage claim .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed collateral dents. Our photo report shows gutter and soft metal dents, confirming storm impact. Collateral is industry-standard proof supporting roof damage .\nQ256: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do gutter dents matter if roof is fine?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGutter dents prove storm severity and direction .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nGutter dents show storm intensity and direction of hail or wind. Even if shingles aren’t visibly missing, collateral confirms storm force. This evidence supports your claim .\nQ257: Adjuster says: \n“No hail hits on vents = no storm damage.”\ndents show storm intensity and direction of hail or wind. Even if shingles aren’t visibly missing, collateral confirms storm force. This evidence supports your claim .\nQ257: Adjuster says: \n“No hail hits on vents = no storm damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows vent and roof hits; both confirm storm .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied damage citing no vent hits. Our photo report documents impacts on vents and shingles. Together, these prove storm activity and functional damage .\nQ258: Carrier says: \n“We won’t cover latent damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF recognizes latent storm damage as functional .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded latent damage. Per GAF guidelines, damage like sealant bond failure and mat fractures may not show immediately but shorten roof life. These are functional damages .\nQ259: Homeowner asks: \n“What is latent storm damage?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHidden damage like fractures or bond failures .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nLatent storm damage refers to hidden problems like mat fractures, sealant failures, or lifted shingles that aren’t immediately obvious. Per GAF, these shorten roof lifespan and void warranty .\nQ260: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover brittle shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBrittleness proven by repair attempt = irreparable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied brittle shingles. Our repair attempt shows shingles cracking when manipulated, proving irreparability. This condition requires full replacement .\nQ261: Carrier says: \n“We won’t accept repair attempt evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard for testing .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve rejected repair attempt documentation. Repair attempts are an industry-standard method to prove reparability. Our documented attempt confirms brittleness and irreparability .\nQ262: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did shingles crack during repair test?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCracking shows shingles are brittle and irreparable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nShingles cracked during the repair test because they’re brittle from age and storm impact. Per our repair attempt template, this confirms repairs are impossible without causing more damage .\nQ263: Adjuster says: \n“Wind lift can be resealed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nrepair test because they’re brittle from age and storm impact. Per our repair attempt template, this confirms repairs are impossible without causing more damage .\nQ263: Adjuster says: \n“Wind lift can be resealed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nResealing isn’t approved; GAF requires replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested resealing wind-lifted shingles. Per GAF, resealing isn’t an approved method.

Ignoring standards makes coverage void .\nQ243: Carrier says: \n“We only cover visible damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLatent damage like sealant failure and mat fractures are functional .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied latent storm damage. Per GAF, sealant bond failures and mat fractures are recognized functional damages, even when not visible to the naked eye .\nQ244: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is latent damage important?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLatent damage shortens roof life and voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nLatent storm damage — like hidden fractures or bond failures — shortens roof lifespan and voids warranty. GAF guidelines recognize these as functional damages requiring replacement .\nQ245: Adjuster says: \n“Wind nicks aren’t significant damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven small wind damage compromises performance per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve minimized wind nicks. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small tears, creases, or\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven small wind damage compromises performance per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve minimized wind nicks. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small tears, creases, or nicks compromise wind resistance and accelerate failure. These damages are functional .\nQ246: Carrier says: \n“Warranty terms don’t apply to claims.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWarranty defines what’s required for proper replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said warranty terms don’t apply. Warranty requirements define what’s necessary for a compliant replacement. Insurance must meet these standards to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ247: Homeowner asks: \n“What if insurance ignores hidden damage?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIgnoring leaves roof compromised; GAF says latent damage matters .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf hidden storm damage is ignored, your roof remains compromised and warranty void. Per GAF guidelines, latent damage is functional and must be addressed .\nQ248: Adjuster says: \n“Manufacturer rules don’t bind us.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThey bind warranty, which is part of restoring pre-loss condition .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve claimed manufacturer rules don’t bind your estimate. They bind warranty validity, which is part of restoring pre-loss condition. A roof without warranty is not properly restored .\nQ249: Carrier says: \n“Warranty void doesn’t matter.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWarranty loss leaves homeowner with no protection .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed warranty loss. A roof without warranty leaves the homeowner unprotected from defects and premature failures. Per GAF guidelines, compliance is required to maintain protection .\nQ250: Homeowner asks: \n“Why should my roof follow manufacturer rules if insurance resists?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFollowing rules ensures durability, compliance, and protection .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nManufacturer rules must be followed because they ensure roof durability, code compliance, and warranty protection. Even if insurance resists, documentation citing GAF guidelines forces compliance .\nQ251: Carrier says: \n“Hail didn’t cause functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms hail causes fractures, bruising, and granule loss .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied hail damage as functional. Per GAF\ndidn’t cause functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF confirms hail causes fractures, bruising, and granule loss .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied hail damage as functional. Per GAF guidelines, hail impact causes fractures, mat bruising, and granule loss. These reduce roof life and warranty coverage. Replacement is required .\nQ252: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see hail strikes in the field.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral confirms storm; field strikes visible in report .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied hail strikes in the field. Our photo report shows collateral impacts on gutters and metals, confirming storm activity. Per GAF, collateral plus bruised shingles establish functional hail damage .\nQ253: Carrier says: \n“Wind lift isn’t permanent damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWind lift breaks sealant, leaving shingles unbonded .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed wind lift as non-damage. Per GAF guidelines, lifted shingles break the sealant bond, reducing wind resistance permanently. This is functional storm damage .\nQ254: Adjuster says: \n“We only replace missing shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCreases, tears, and uplifts are also functional damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve limited scope to missing shingles. Per GAF, wind creases, tears, and uplifted shingles are functional damage. They require replacement along with missing tabs .\nQ255: Carrier says: \n“Collateral dents don’t matter.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral proves storm event and supports roof damage claim .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed collateral dents. Our photo report shows gutter and soft metal dents, confirming storm impact. Collateral is industry-standard proof supporting roof damage .\nQ256: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do gutter dents matter if roof is fine?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGutter dents prove storm severity and direction .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nGutter dents show storm intensity and direction of hail or wind. Even if shingles aren’t visibly missing, collateral confirms storm force. This evidence supports your claim .\nQ257: Adjuster says: \n“No hail hits on vents = no storm damage.”\ndents show storm intensity and direction of hail or wind. Even if shingles aren’t visibly missing, collateral confirms storm force. This evidence supports your claim .\nQ257: Adjuster says: \n“No hail hits on vents = no storm damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows vent and roof hits; both confirm storm .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied damage citing no vent hits. Our photo report documents impacts on vents and shingles. Together, these prove storm activity and functional damage .\nQ258: Carrier says: \n“We won’t cover latent damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF recognizes latent storm damage as functional .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded latent damage. Per GAF guidelines, damage like sealant bond failure and mat fractures may not show immediately but shorten roof life. These are functional damages .\nQ259: Homeowner asks: \n“What is latent storm damage?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHidden damage like fractures or bond failures .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nLatent storm damage refers to hidden problems like mat fractures, sealant failures, or lifted shingles that aren’t immediately obvious. Per GAF, these shorten roof lifespan and void warranty .\nQ260: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover brittle shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBrittleness proven by repair attempt = irreparable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied brittle shingles. Our repair attempt shows shingles cracking when manipulated, proving irreparability. This condition requires full replacement .\nQ261: Carrier says: \n“We won’t accept repair attempt evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard for testing .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve rejected repair attempt documentation. Repair attempts are an industry-standard method to prove reparability. Our documented attempt confirms brittleness and irreparability .\nQ262: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did shingles crack during repair test?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCracking shows shingles are brittle and irreparable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nShingles cracked during the repair test because they’re brittle from age and storm impact. Per our repair attempt template, this confirms repairs are impossible without causing more damage .\nQ263: Adjuster says: \n“Wind lift can be resealed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nrepair test because they’re brittle from age and storm impact. Per our repair attempt template, this confirms repairs are impossible without causing more damage .\nQ263: Adjuster says: \n“Wind lift can be resealed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nResealing isn’t approved; GAF requires replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested resealing wind-lifted shingles. Per GAF, resealing isn’t an approved method. Replacement is required to maintain roof integrity and warranty .\nQ264: Carrier says: \n“One slope repair is sufficient.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStorm affected multiple slopes; partial repair is inadequate .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only one slope. Our generic partial template and photo report show storm damage across multiple slopes. Full replacement is required for all impacted areas .\nQ265: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you document slopes separately?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEach slope may show unique storm impacts .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe document slopes separately because storm damage can vary by slope due to wind direction and hail patterns. Our photo report template ensures each slope’s damage is clearly documented .\nQ266: Adjuster says: \n“Gutter damage doesn’t prove roof damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral confirms storm severity and supports claim .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said gutter damage doesn’t prove roof damage. Collateral impacts are industry-standard proof of storm severity and direction, supporting roof replacement claims .\nQ267: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for collateral.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral proves storm event; part of total claim .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied collateral coverage. Collateral (gutters, vents, metals) proves storm event and is part of the overall claim. Excluding it ignores valid storm impacts .\nQ268: Homeowner asks: \n“Why take so many photos?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhotos create permanent, objective record of damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe take photos to create a permanent, objective record of storm damage. Even if adjusters miss items, the photo report captures evidence for the claim .\nQ269: Adjuster says: \n“Mat bruises won’t cause leaks.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBruises fracture asphalt mat; shorten roof life\nstorm damage. Even if adjusters miss items, the photo report captures evidence for the claim .\nQ269: Adjuster says: \n“Mat bruises won’t cause leaks.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBruises fracture asphalt mat; shorten roof life .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed mat bruises. Per GAF, hail bruises fracture the asphalt mat beneath granules. This weakens waterproofing and accelerates roof failure, requiring replacement .\nQ270: Carrier says: \n“Wind creases can be sealed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCreases weaken shingles permanently; not repairable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said creases can be sealed. Per GAF guidelines, creases break the fiberglass mat and weaken the shingle permanently. Sealant doesn’t restore strength; replacement required .\nQ271: Homeowner asks: \n“Why document bruises if no leaks yet?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBruises shorten life and void warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe document bruises even without leaks because they shorten roof life and void manufacturer warranty. Per GAF, bruises are functional damage requiring replacement .\nQ272: Adjuster says: \n“Sealant damage is normal aging.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStorm-caused sealant failure differs from aging .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve called sealant failure normal aging. Per GAF, storm-caused sealant failure shows distinct patterns, unlike slow deterioration. These are functional storm damages .\nQ273: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for slope with few hits.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven few hits per slope = replacement per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded a slope with “few hits.” Per GAF guidelines, even limited hits compromise slope integrity and void warranty. Replacement required for that slope .\nQ274: Homeowner asks: \n“How many hail hits = replacement?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo set number; any functional hits justify replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThere’s no universal number of hits required. If hail causes functional damage — bruises, cracks, granule loss — then replacement is warranted per GAF. Even a few hits can justify full slope replacement .\nQ275: Adjuster says: \n“Wind-lifted shingles can be hand-sealed.”\nShort Answer\n— bruises, cracks, granule loss — then replacement is warranted per GAF. Even a few hits can justify full slope replacement .\nQ275: Adjuster says: \n“Wind-lifted shingles can be hand-sealed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHand-sealing isn’t GAF-approved repair .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed hand-sealing lifted shingles. Per GAF guidelines, this method isn’t approved. Lifted shingles lose integrity and require replacement .\nQ276: Carrier says: \n“We don’t cover flashing replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFlashing must be replaced when disturbed during reroofing .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied flashing replacement. Per flashing code requirements, flashing must be replaced when roofing materials are removed. Reusing flashing violates code and manufacturer warranty .\nQ277: Adjuster says: \n“Drip edge isn’t required.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDrip edge required by code and manufacturer .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied drip edge. Per flashing codes and GAF guidelines, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes for water control and warranty compliance .\nQ278: Carrier says: \n“Valley metal can be reused.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nValley metal must be replaced during reroof .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved reusing valley metal. Per flashing code, valley flashing must be replaced when disturbed during reroofing. Reuse fails inspection and voids warranty .\nQ279: Homeowner asks: \n“Why does flashing matter?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFlashing protects roof transitions from leaks .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFlashing matters because it protects vulnerable roof transitions like chimneys, valleys, and walls. Per flashing code, it must be properly replaced to prevent water intrusion .\nQ280: Adjuster says: \n“Pipe boots can be reused.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPipe boots deteriorate; must be replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested reusing pipe boots. Per GAF guidelines, pipe boots deteriorate with age and must be replaced during reroofing. Reuse creates immediate failure risk .\nQ281: Carrier says: \n“Step flashing can stay.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStep flashing\n. Per GAF guidelines, pipe boots deteriorate with age and must be replaced during reroofing. Reuse creates immediate failure risk .\nQ281: Carrier says: \n“Step flashing can stay.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStep flashing must be replaced with roof covering .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied step flashing replacement. Per flashing codes, step flashing is required to be replaced whenever shingles are replaced. Reusing is not code-compliant .\nQ282: Homeowner asks: \n“What’s step flashing?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMetal flashing that protects wall-to-roof transitions .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nStep flashing is the L-shaped metal installed where the roof meets walls or chimneys. It diverts water away from these transitions. Per flashing code, it must be replaced during reroofing .\nQ283: Adjuster says: \n“Ice and water shield isn’t needed here.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRequired by Virginia code in eaves prone to ice dams .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ice and water shield. Per Virginia building code, an ice barrier is required at eaves in areas prone to ice dams. Omission violates state code .\nQ284: Carrier says: \n“Underlayment reuse is fine.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nUnderlayment must be replaced with new covering .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved underlayment reuse. Per GAF slope replacement requirements, new underlayment must be installed with new shingles. Reuse voids warranty .\nQ285: Homeowner asks: \n“What’s underlayment?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nProtective layer between decking and shingles .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nUnderlayment is the protective sheet between roof decking and shingles. It provides secondary waterproofing. Per GAF, it must be replaced whenever reroofing occurs .\nQ286: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for ridge vent.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vent required by GAF for ventilation warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied ridge vent coverage. Per GAF guidelines, proper ventilation is required for warranty. Ridge vents are the most effective ventilation method and must be included .\nQ287: Carrier says: \n“Box vents are good enough.”\nShort Answer (\n,\nYou’ve denied ridge vent coverage. Per GAF guidelines, proper ventilation is required for warranty. Ridge vents are the most effective ventilation method and must be included .\nQ287: Carrier says: \n“Box vents are good enough.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vent ensures continuous airflow; box vents may not .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed box vents only. Per GAF, ridge vent provides continuous airflow across the ridge and is required for proper performance. Box vents are insufficient on their own .\nQ288: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do I need ventilation?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVentilation prevents heat and moisture damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nVentilation prevents heat and moisture buildup in the attic, which causes shingle deterioration and mold.

    "content": "Documentation & Templates (Q101–Q125)\nQ101: Question: \nWhen should the Repair Attempt Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when a repair was attempted and shingles cracked, tore, or failed — proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Repair Attempt Template should be used anytime a repair test is performed and the shingles crack, tear, or break when manipulated. This template documents the attempt and outcome, proving to insurance that repairs are not feasible. It provides a professional, standardized way to present irreparability .\nQ102: Adjuster says: \n“Repair attempt wasn’t necessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard to determine reparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair attempts are an industry-accepted method to test whether shingles are repairable. Our documented attempt caused additional damage, confirming brittleness and irreparability. This supports the need for full replacement .\nQ103: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did you damage my roof during testing?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is standard and proves shingles can’t be repaired .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe brittle test may look like damage, but it’s an industry-accepted method to confirm whether shingles are repairable. By carefully attempting to lift and reseal shingles, we document whether they fracture. If they do, as in this case, it proves irreparability and strengthens your claim for full replacement .\nQ104: Carrier says: \n“Your repair attempt caused the damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage during repair attempt proves brittleness, not contractor error .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our repair attempt caused the damage. In reality, the cracking during the attempt is the proof of brittleness and irreparability. The Repair Attempt Template documents this result. Repairs would cause more harm, confirming the need for replacement .\nQ105: Question: \nWhen should the Generic Partial Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when insurance approves only part of a roof/siding but evidence supports more .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\n.\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\nQ106: Adjuster says: \n“We only approved the slope with visible damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur inspection found collateral damage across multiple slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved one slope only. Our inspection and photo report show consistent collateral damage across multiple slopes. Storm impact is not limited to a single slope. The Generic Partial Template language applies to request revision .\nQ107: Carrier says: \n“We left gutters out — no evidence of damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows gutter dents and granule wash consistent with storm .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou omitted gutters. Our photo report shows storm-related dents and granule washout in gutters. These are valid storm impacts that must be included. The Generic Partial Template can be used to request full scope .\nQ108: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover siding on one wall only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland matching requirement prohibits mismatched siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour approval of one siding wall ignores matching requirements. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless excluded by policy. The Generic Partial Template applies to request full replacement .\nQ109: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do we need the Generic Partial Template?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt challenges partial approvals by showing all affected areas .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is needed when the insurance company tries to pay for only part of the damage. It uses standardized language to point out that storm damage affected more than just one slope or wall. It helps push for full approval .\nQ110: Question: \nWhen should the Photo Report Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse whenever submitting photographic proof of damage to insurance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Photo Report Template should be used whenever you compile photographic evidence of storm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nstorm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report documents creases, mat exposure, and missing shingles .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our photos. The Photo Report Template clearly documents creased shingles, exposed mats, and missing tabs. These conditions are functional damage, not cosmetic, and require replacement .\nQ112: Carrier says: \n“Collateral damage isn’t covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) helps prove storm event .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded collateral. Our photo report documents dents in gutters and metals. These items confirm storm event impact and must be considered when determining full scope .\nQ113: Homeowner asks: \n“Why are photos important if the adjuster already inspected?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhotos create a permanent record and highlight missed damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nPhotos are essential because they provide a permanent, timestamped record of storm damage. Even if an adjuster inspected, photos highlight missed or overlooked issues. The Photo Report Template ensures this evidence is presented clearly .\nQ114: Adjuster says: \n“Your photos don’t show hail size.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage, not hail size, determines coverage — shown in report .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our photos due to hail size. Insurance coverage is based on damage, not size. Our photo report documents functional impacts: bruises, granule loss, and fractures. These require replacement regardless of stone size .\nQ115: Carrier says: \n“Photos aren’t professional evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto reports are industry standard for claim documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated photos aren’t valid evidence. In fact, photo reports are an industry standard and form part of nearly every claim review. They are recognized as valid proof of storm damage .\nQ116: Question: \nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier\nQuestion: \nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier delays, denies, or refuses fair inspection. Insurance companies respond more seriously when the request comes directly from their policyholder. This template ensures the homeowner speaks in the right language .\nQ117: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do I need to send the letter instead of Roof-ER?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInsurance responds more when it comes from the policyholder .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nInsurance companies must respond directly to their customers. When Roof-ER sends a letter, it may not carry the same weight. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures the homeowner applies pressure themselves, often getting faster results .\nQ118: Carrier says: \n“We already explained our decision.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCustomer letter reinforces their rights and requests reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nThe policyholder has the right to challenge your decision. Using the Customer-to-Insurance Template, they’ve reiterated their request for fair handling and restoration to pre-loss condition. A customer’s direct appeal requires serious consideration .\nQ119: Homeowner asks: \n“What if I don’t feel comfortable pushing insurance?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe provide the template — they just copy/paste it .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe homeowner doesn’t need to “fight” with insurance. They simply copy/paste the provided Customer-to-Insurance Template into an email and send it. Roof-ER provides the wording; the customer’s role is only to hit send .\nQ120: Adjuster says: \n“Customer letters don’t change anything.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarrier must respond when request comes from policyholder .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said customer letters don’t matter. However, you are required to respond directly to the policyholder. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures their request is framed clearly. This obligates a reconsideration under fair claims handling .\nQ121: Question: \nWhen should the Siding Argument Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mism\niding Argument Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mismatches, or because removal of housewrap causes consequential damage. It standardizes the language for challenging siding denials .\nQ122: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace one siding panel.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPanel removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed panel replacement. Per our siding argument documentation, removing one panel requires detaching adjoining ones and often the corner post. This causes consequential damage and makes panel-only replacement infeasible .\nQ123: Carrier says: \n“We found a close match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirmed no reasonable match exists; close isn’t acceptable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated a close siding match exists. The iTel report confirms no reasonable match is available. Color and profile mismatches reduce property value and fail to restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\nQ124: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just paint or blend siding?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPainting/mixing voids warranty and doesn’t restore pre-loss condition .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nPainting or blending siding may seem like a solution, but it voids manufacturer warranty and doesn’t restore the home to its pre-loss condition. The Siding Argument Template explains why only full replacement is acceptable .\nQ125: Adjuster says: \n“Housewrap isn’t necessary for siding repair.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMD Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier behind siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied housewrap during siding repair. Per Maryland Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting WRB violates code and risks moisture intrusion. This must be included .\nQ126: Carrier says: \n“We can repair aluminum siding dents.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nAluminum siding dents are permanent; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be\nents are permanent; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be replaced to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ127: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace a few vinyl panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVinyl becomes brittle with age; panel removal causes cracking .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only a few vinyl siding panels. Per our siding argument, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks when removed, making panel-only replacement impossible. Full wall replacement is required .\nQ128: Carrier says: \n“We’ll blend new siding with old.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBlending creates mismatched color/profile; iTel confirms no match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed blending new with old siding. The iTel report confirms no suitable match is available. Mixing profiles and colors creates mismatches and does not restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\nQ129: Homeowner asks: \n“What if siding mismatch doesn’t bother me?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInsurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nEven if mismatches don’t bother the homeowner, insurance is obligated to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. Per our siding argument, mismatched siding reduces value and fails to meet claim requirements .\nQ130: Carrier says: \n“We’ll paint siding to match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPainting voids warranty and fades differently than factory siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested painting new siding to match. Per our siding argument, painting siding voids manufacturer warranty and fades unevenly compared to factory finish. This is not a valid repair. Replacement is required .\nQ131: Question: \nWhen should the Estimate Request Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when insurance estimate omits items or underpays scope .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Estimate Request Template is used whenever the insurance estimate is incomplete — missing items like flashing, underlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .\nQ132: Adjuster says: \n“Our estimate is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence requires revision — outlined in\nunderlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .\nQ132: Adjuster says: \n“Our estimate is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence requires revision — outlined in Estimate Request Template .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said the estimate is final. The Estimate Request Template provides standardized language to show new documentation (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires revision of your estimate. We respectfully request corrections .\nQ133: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for code compliance.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template cites VA/MD code upgrades .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied code items. The Estimate Request Template language cites specific state codes, such as Maryland Code R703 (WRB) and VA Code 908.5 (flashing). These are not optional — they are code requirements that must be included .\nQ134: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is your estimate higher than insurance’s?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe include all code-required and manufacturer-required items .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nOur estimate may be higher because it includes all code-required upgrades and manufacturer-required components that insurance sometimes leaves out. The Estimate Request Template is how we push back to ensure these are included .\nQ135: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t pay for underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires new underlayment; reusing voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF installation standards, new underlayment must be installed when reroofing. Reusing underlayment voids warranty. The Estimate Request Template language requests this correction .\nQ136: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFlashing replacement required by VA Code 908.5 .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, all damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced when reroofing. This is a code requirement, not optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n“We priced shingles too low.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom\nnot optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n“We priced shingles too low.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nThe shingle pricing in your estimate is below current market value. The Estimate Request Template provides language to request market-appropriate pricing corrections. This ensures the claim reflects actual replacement costs .\nQ138: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did insurance’s estimate leave items out?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarriers often omit code/manufacturer items — we use Estimate Request Template to fix .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nInsurance estimates frequently omit items like drip edge, flashing, or WRB. These omissions reduce the payout. We use the Estimate Request Template to point out and correct these errors so the homeowner receives full coverage .\nQ139: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for WRB.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded WRB. Per Maryland Code R703, siding must include a water-resistive barrier. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement and requests correction .\nQ140: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for ridge vent.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vents must be removed for slope replacement; new required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing slopes and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template requests this correction .\nQ141: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for drip edge.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIRC requires drip edge at eaves and rakes .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded drip edge. Per the IRC adopted in Virginia, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement for correction .\nQ142: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to send estimate corrections?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCorrections ensure code compliance and fair market value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe send estimate corrections to ensure all code-required items and market-appropriate pricing are included. Without corrections, homeowners are left with underfunded claims. The Estimate Request Template makes these corrections formal .\nQ\nfair market value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe send estimate corrections to ensure all code-required items and market-appropriate pricing are included. Without corrections, homeowners are left with underfunded claims. The Estimate Request Template makes these corrections formal .\nQ143: Adjuster says: \n“Your corrections aren’t valid.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCorrections are backed by manufacturer guidelines and state code .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve rejected our corrections.

Per IRC R703.4, flashing is required at all penetrations, including chimneys. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\nQ147: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t pay for skylight flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSkylight flashing must be replaced when roof is replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations. Skylight flashing cannot be reused and must be replaced. The Estimate Request Template addresses this correction .\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it\n.\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it eliminates subjectivity. Carriers cannot deny items required by law. The Estimate Request Template ensures each correction is supported by code .\nQ149: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires starter strips at eaves/rakes for wind warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind warranty. The Estimate Request Template ensures these are included .\nQ150: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover ridge caps.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge caps must be replaced when slopes are replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\nQ151: Question: \nWhen should the iTel Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when shingles/siding are discontinued and repairs would cause mismatches .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe iTel Template is used whenever a carrier suggests patching, but iTel testing confirms the shingles or siding are discontinued. By citing iTel’s lab analysis and the Discontinued Shingle List, it proves no suitable replacement exists and full replacement is required .\nQ152: Adjuster says: \n“We found similar shingles available.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirmed no match exists; mixing voids manufacturer warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested similar shingles are available. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued with no acceptable match. Installing mismatched shingles violates manufacturer warranty and reduces property value. Full replacement is required .\nQ153: Carrier says: \n“Metric shingles can replace English dimension.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMetric and English shingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent\nshingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent proper sealant alignment. This misalignment voids warranty and fails to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ154: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just mix old and new shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant alignment .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nMixing discontinued shingles with new ones creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant placement. These differences compromise wind resistance and void manufacturer warranty. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms no compatible products are available .\nQ155: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll only replace damaged shingles, not full slope.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirms discontinued; partial replacement isn’t possible .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed replacing only visibly damaged shingles. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued. Since replacements cannot match, partial repairs would be defective. Full slope replacement is the only solution .\nQ156: Carrier says: \n“We can still patch siding with a close match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nClose match isn’t acceptable; iTel confirms discontinued siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested patching siding with a close match. The iTel analysis confirms the siding is discontinued and no match exists. Mismatched siding reduces property value and violates Maryland matching regulations .\nQ157: Homeowner asks: \n“What is an iTel report?”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel is a lab test confirming material type and availability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAn iTel report is a laboratory analysis of a material sample (shingle, siding, etc.). It confirms product type, manufacturer, and whether it is still available. If discontinued, it provides written proof repairs are not feasible .\nQ158: Carrier says: \n“We don’t accept iTel reports.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel is independent lab analysis widely accepted in the industry .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and\nwidely accepted in the industry .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and provide objective proof of discontinuation .\nQ159: Adjuster says: \n“Shingles look available at Home Depot.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRetail stores don’t confirm compatibility; iTel confirms discontinuation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated similar shingles appear in retail stores. Availability at retail does not guarantee dimensional compatibility. The iTel report confirms the original shingles are discontinued and no suitable match exists .\nQ160: Homeowner asks: \n“Why does discontinued matter if roof still works?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued means no repairs possible without mismatching .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf shingles are discontinued, no replacements match in size, color, or sealant alignment. This makes repairs impossible without mismatching. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms when a roof system can no longer be patched, requiring full replacement .\nQ161: Carrier says: \n“We’ll approve repair, not replacement, despite iTel.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel proves repairs impossible; replacement is required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved repair despite iTel findings. The iTel report proves the product is discontinued, making repairs impossible without mismatches. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ162: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll blend different shingle lots.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLot variations cause color mismatch; iTel confirms no true match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested blending different lots of shingles. Lot variations cause visible color mismatches, and per the iTel report, the original shingles are discontinued. No blending can restore uniformity. Full replacement is required .\nQ163: Carrier says: \n“Discontinued list isn’t proof.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued list + iTel lab analysis confirm unavailability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t\n’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just re-use old shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOld shingles crack when lifted; repair attempt shows brittleness .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nReusing old shingles isn’t possible because once lifted, they crack or fail to reseal. Our repair attempt video documents brittleness. Combined with discontinued status, reuse is not feasible .\nQ165: Adjuster says: \n“New manufacturer products are close enough.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing brands violates warranty and reduces property value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed using a different manufacturer’s product. Mixing brands voids warranty and creates mismatches in size and color. The iTel report confirms no acceptable alternative exists .\nQ166: Carrier says: \n“We’ll pay for only a few discontinued panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPartial payment ignores irreparability proven by iTel .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve offered to pay for a few discontinued panels. The iTel report proves no matches exist, so partial repairs aren’t feasible. Full replacement is required .\nQ167: Homeowner asks: \n“How does iTel help my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt provides third-party proof repairs aren’t possible .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAn iTel report is powerful because it’s a third-party lab test confirming discontinuation. Insurance companies must consider it credible evidence that repairs are not possible. It directly supports full replacement .\nQ168: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t need third-party verification.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel provides unbiased lab confirmation; not contractor opinion .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed iTel verification. Unlike contractor opinion, iTel is unbiased lab testing. It confirms material discontinuation in an objective, industry-accepted format .\nQ169: Carrier says: \n“We’ll allow repair with different dimensions.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric\nAnswer (with source):\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric sizes do not align, leaving sealant strips misaligned and vulnerable. Repairs are unsafe; full replacement is required .\nQ170: Homeowner asks: \n“Can insurance force me to accept mismatched materials?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — insurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nNo, insurance cannot force mismatched repairs. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding and roofing are not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in policy. You’re entitled to full replacement .\nQ171: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just caulk or seal damaged shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCaulking is not manufacturer-approved repair; voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed caulking damaged shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, caulking is not an approved repair method and voids warranty. Replacement is required .\nQ172: Carrier says: \n“We won’t accept discontinued list as evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued list + iTel confirm no replacement available .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. When paired with iTel lab testing, the Discontinued Shingle List confirms no suitable replacement is available. Together, they provide conclusive proof .\nQ173: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens if we can’t match?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode and regulations require full replacement when mismatching .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf a match isn’t possible, full replacement is required. Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 confirms that mismatched siding or roofing isn’t acceptable unless excluded in the policy .\nQ174: Adjuster says: \n“We can reuse discontinued shingles from repair stock.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStored shingles won’t align in color/age; still discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested using repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\nQ175: Carrier says:\nusing repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\nQ175: Carrier says: \n“We’ll patch siding with leftover stock.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLeftover siding won’t match aged/weathered walls; iTel confirms discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested using leftover siding stock. These pieces won’t match weathered siding on the home, and the iTel report confirms the line is discontinued. Patching with leftovers does not restore pre-loss condition .\nQ176: Question: \nWhen should the Arbitration Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier denies all appeals and homeowner seeks neutral review .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Arbitration Template should be used when all internal appeals with the insurance company have been exhausted and the carrier maintains denial. It initiates a neutral review process where an arbitrator evaluates the dispute. This forces the carrier to defend their denial against documented evidence .\nQ177: Carrier says: \n“Denial is final and not appealable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is a valid escalation option under policy rights .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the denial is final. Per the Arbitration Information template, the policyholder maintains the right to escalate unresolved disputes through arbitration. This process ensures fair claim handling beyond internal review .\nQ178: Homeowner asks: \n“What is arbitration?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is a neutral third-party review of the claim .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nArbitration is when a neutral third-party arbitrator reviews the evidence from both sides — homeowner and carrier — and makes a binding or advisory decision. It’s an escalation step if the carrier refuses to honor valid claim documentation .\nQ179: Carrier says: \n“Arbitration doesn’t apply here.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIf policy includes arbitration, carrier must participate .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration. If the policy includes arbitration provisions, the carrier must participate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and\nparticipate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and still binding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nArbitration avoids the delays and costs of lawsuits while still offering neutral review. It’s faster, more affordable, and often binding depending on policy terms. The Arbitration Template helps initiate this option effectively .\nQ181: Question: \nWhen should Complaint Forms be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier mishandles claim or refuses fair handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nComplaint Forms should be used when an insurance company delays, denies, or mishandles a claim unfairly. Filing with the state insurance administration creates oversight and pressures carriers to comply with fair claims practices .\nQ182: Carrier says: \n“State complaints won’t change our decision.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints trigger regulatory oversight carriers must respond to .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints won’t matter. Filing a state complaint forces regulatory oversight. Carriers must respond to the state authority, creating accountability in claim handling .\nQ183: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens after I file a complaint?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe state reviews carrier actions and demands formal response .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAfter you file a complaint, the state insurance administration reviews the carrier’s handling of your claim. The carrier must provide a formal written response. This often leads to claim reconsideration .\nQ184: Adjuster says: \n“Complaints are just paperwork.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints document mishandling and force carrier accountability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed complaints as meaningless. In fact, complaints document mishandling and force accountability under state oversight. Carriers must provide a formal justification, often leading to fairer outcomes .\nQ185: Homeowner asks: \n“Will filing a complaint hurt my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — it enforces fair handling and protects your rights .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\nQ186: Carrier says: \n“We don’t recognize\nTraining Draft):\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\nQ186: Carrier says: \n“We don’t recognize state complaints.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarriers are required by law to respond to complaints .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t recognize state complaints. By law, carriers must respond to oversight inquiries. Filing a Complaint Form compels this response and ensures review of claim handling .\nQ187: Question: \nWhen should both Arbitration and Complaint Forms be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier refuses reconsideration and claim is unresolved .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nBoth Arbitration and Complaint Forms should be used when a carrier refuses reconsideration despite documentation. Arbitration applies policy provisions for neutral review, while complaints trigger state oversight. Together, they maximize pressure for resolution .\nQ188: Homeowner asks: \n“Which should I do first: arbitration or complaint?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaint first for oversight; arbitration if still unresolved .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nGenerally, filing a complaint first is recommended because it creates regulatory oversight. If the carrier still refuses, then proceed to arbitration. Both paths are valid, but this order applies the most pressure .\nQ189: Carrier says: \n“We won’t change claim regardless of oversight.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOversight and arbitration hold carriers accountable by law .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated oversight won’t affect your decision. State regulators and arbitration provisions exist specifically to hold carriers accountable. Ignoring either is a violation of fair claim handling .\nQ190: Homeowner asks: \n“Do many people file complaints?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nYes — complaints are common and effective for unfair denials .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nYes, many homeowners file complaints when claims are unfairly denied or delayed. The Complaint Form process is standard and often leads to faster, fairer resolution .\nQ191: Carrier says: \n“We won’t respond to arbitration.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPolicy provisions require participation once initiated .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\nrequire participation once initiated .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\nQ192: Adjuster says: \n“Arbitration is just advisory.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMany arbitration decisions are binding per policy terms .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said arbitration is advisory only. Many policies make arbitration binding. Even when advisory, arbitrators’ decisions strongly influence resolution. The Arbitration Template enforces this right .\nQ193: Homeowner asks: \n“What if complaint doesn’t work?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nProceed to arbitration or escalate legally .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf a complaint doesn’t resolve the issue, the next step is arbitration or legal escalation. Complaints create oversight, but arbitration provides binding or advisory resolution if denial persists .\nQ194: Carrier says: \n“Customer has no further rights.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCustomer has right to complaint, arbitration, and legal action .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the customer has no further rights. In fact, policyholders maintain the right to complaints, arbitration, and legal remedies. Denying these rights is a violation of fair claims practices .\nQ195: Homeowner asks: \n“Is complaint filing complicated?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — forms are simple and Roof-ER provides guidance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFiling a complaint is straightforward. The forms are simple, and Roof-ER provides the homeowner with templates and step-by-step guidance. The Complaint Forms make the process efficient .\nQ196: Adjuster says: \n“Complaints waste time.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints are official state action carriers must respond to .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints waste time. In reality, complaints initiate state action that requires a carrier response. They are a valid escalation and often change claim outcomes .\nQ197: Carrier says: \n“Arbitration is too costly.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster and cheaper than litigation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration as costly. Arbitration is significantly faster and cheaper than litigation for both sides. It’s a valid escalation provided in\n):\nArbitration is faster and cheaper than litigation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration as costly. Arbitration is significantly faster and cheaper than litigation for both sides. It’s a valid escalation provided in many policies .\nQ198: Homeowner asks: \n“Will Roof-ER help with complaints/arbitration?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nYes — Roof-ER provides templates and guidance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nYes, Roof-ER supports homeowners through both complaints and arbitration. We provide templates, documentation, and coaching so customers can file confidently. The Arbitration and Complaint Forms are designed to make this process easy .\nQ199: Carrier says: \n“Complaints don’t prove storm damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints enforce fair handling, not damage proof .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints don’t prove damage. That is correct — complaints enforce fair handling of claims. Damage proof comes from repair attempts, iTel, and photo reports. Complaints ensure carriers treat this documentation fairly .\nQ200: Homeowner asks: \n“What’s the final step if all else fails?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLegal escalation is last resort after complaint/arbitration .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf both complaints and arbitration fail, the final step is legal escalation. Roof-ER can provide documentation and guidance, but attorneys handle this stage. Arbitration and complaints usually resolve issues before legal action is needed .\nDocumentation & Templates (Q101–Q125)\nQ101: Question: \nWhen should the Repair Attempt Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when a repair was attempted and shingles cracked, tore, or failed — proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Repair Attempt Template should be used anytime a repair test is performed and the shingles crack, tear, or break when manipulated. This template documents the attempt and outcome, proving to insurance that repairs are not feasible. It provides a professional, standardized way to present irreparability .\nQ102: Adjuster says: \n“Repair attempt wasn’t necessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard to determine reparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair attempts are an industry-accepted method to test whether shingles are repairable. Our documented attempt caused additional damage, confirming brittleness and irreparability. This supports the need for full replacement .\nQ103: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did you damage my roof during testing?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is standard and proves shingles can’t be repaired .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe brittle test may look like damage, but it’s an industry-accepted method to confirm whether shingles are repairable. By carefully attempting to lift and reseal shingles, we document whether they fracture. If they do, as in this case, it proves irreparability and strengthens your claim for full replacement .\nQ104: Carrier says: \n“Your repair attempt caused the damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage during repair attempt proves brittleness, not contractor error .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our repair attempt caused the damage. In reality, the cracking during the attempt is the proof of brittleness and irreparability. The Repair Attempt Template documents this result. Repairs would cause more harm, confirming the need for replacement .\nQ105: Question: \nWhen should the Generic Partial Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when insurance approves only part of a roof/siding but evidence supports more .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\n.\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\nQ106: Adjuster says: \n“We only approved the slope with visible damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur inspection found collateral damage across multiple slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved one slope only. Our inspection and photo report show consistent collateral damage across multiple slopes. Storm impact is not limited to a single slope. The Generic Partial Template language applies to request revision .\nQ107: Carrier says: \n“We left gutters out — no evidence of damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows gutter dents and granule wash consistent with storm .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou omitted gutters. Our photo report shows storm-related dents and granule washout in gutters. These are valid storm impacts that must be included. The Generic Partial Template can be used to request full scope .\nQ108: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover siding on one wall only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland matching requirement prohibits mismatched siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour approval of one siding wall ignores matching requirements. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless excluded by policy. The Generic Partial Template applies to request full replacement .\nQ109: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do we need the Generic Partial Template?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt challenges partial approvals by showing all affected areas .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is needed when the insurance company tries to pay for only part of the damage. It uses standardized language to point out that storm damage affected more than just one slope or wall. It helps push for full approval .\nQ110: Question: \nWhen should the Photo Report Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse whenever submitting photographic proof of damage to insurance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Photo Report Template should be used whenever you compile photographic evidence of storm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nstorm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report documents creases, mat exposure, and missing shingles .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our photos. The Photo Report Template clearly documents creased shingles, exposed mats, and missing tabs. These conditions are functional damage, not cosmetic, and require replacement .\nQ112: Carrier says: \n“Collateral damage isn’t covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) helps prove storm event .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded collateral. Our photo report documents dents in gutters and metals. These items confirm storm event impact and must be considered when determining full scope .\nQ113: Homeowner asks: \n“Why are photos important if the adjuster already inspected?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhotos create a permanent record and highlight missed damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nPhotos are essential because they provide a permanent, timestamped record of storm damage. Even if an adjuster inspected, photos highlight missed or overlooked issues. The Photo Report Template ensures this evidence is presented clearly .\nQ114: Adjuster says: \n“Your photos don’t show hail size.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage, not hail size, determines coverage — shown in report .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our photos due to hail size. Insurance coverage is based on damage, not size. Our photo report documents functional impacts: bruises, granule loss, and fractures. These require replacement regardless of stone size .\nQ115: Carrier says: \n“Photos aren’t professional evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto reports are industry standard for claim documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated photos aren’t valid evidence. In fact, photo reports are an industry standard and form part of nearly every claim review. They are recognized as valid proof of storm damage .\nQ116: Question: \nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier\nQuestion: \nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier delays, denies, or refuses fair inspection. Insurance companies respond more seriously when the request comes directly from their policyholder. This template ensures the homeowner speaks in the right language .\nQ117: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do I need to send the letter instead of Roof-ER?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInsurance responds more when it comes from the policyholder .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nInsurance companies must respond directly to their customers. When Roof-ER sends a letter, it may not carry the same weight. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures the homeowner applies pressure themselves, often getting faster results .\nQ118: Carrier says: \n“We already explained our decision.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCustomer letter reinforces their rights and requests reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nThe policyholder has the right to challenge your decision. Using the Customer-to-Insurance Template, they’ve reiterated their request for fair handling and restoration to pre-loss condition. A customer’s direct appeal requires serious consideration .\nQ119: Homeowner asks: \n“What if I don’t feel comfortable pushing insurance?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe provide the template — they just copy/paste it .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe homeowner doesn’t need to “fight” with insurance. They simply copy/paste the provided Customer-to-Insurance Template into an email and send it. Roof-ER provides the wording; the customer’s role is only to hit send .\nQ120: Adjuster says: \n“Customer letters don’t change anything.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarrier must respond when request comes from policyholder .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said customer letters don’t matter. However, you are required to respond directly to the policyholder. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures their request is framed clearly. This obligates a reconsideration under fair claims handling .\nQ121: Question: \nWhen should the Siding Argument Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mism\niding Argument Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mismatches, or because removal of housewrap causes consequential damage. It standardizes the language for challenging siding denials .\nQ122: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace one siding panel.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPanel removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed panel replacement. Per our siding argument documentation, removing one panel requires detaching adjoining ones and often the corner post. This causes consequential damage and makes panel-only replacement infeasible .\nQ123: Carrier says: \n“We found a close match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirmed no reasonable match exists; close isn’t acceptable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated a close siding match exists. The iTel report confirms no reasonable match is available. Color and profile mismatches reduce property value and fail to restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\nQ124: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just paint or blend siding?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPainting/mixing voids warranty and doesn’t restore pre-loss condition .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nPainting or blending siding may seem like a solution, but it voids manufacturer warranty and doesn’t restore the home to its pre-loss condition. The Siding Argument Template explains why only full replacement is acceptable .\nQ125: Adjuster says: \n“Housewrap isn’t necessary for siding repair.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMD Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier behind siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied housewrap during siding repair. Per Maryland Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting WRB violates code and risks moisture intrusion. This must be included .\nQ126: Carrier says: \n“We can repair aluminum siding dents.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nAluminum siding dents are permanent; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be\nents are permanent; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be replaced to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ127: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace a few vinyl panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVinyl becomes brittle with age; panel removal causes cracking .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only a few vinyl siding panels. Per our siding argument, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks when removed, making panel-only replacement impossible. Full wall replacement is required .\nQ128: Carrier says: \n“We’ll blend new siding with old.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBlending creates mismatched color/profile; iTel confirms no match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed blending new with old siding. The iTel report confirms no suitable match is available. Mixing profiles and colors creates mismatches and does not restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\nQ129: Homeowner asks: \n“What if siding mismatch doesn’t bother me?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInsurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nEven if mismatches don’t bother the homeowner, insurance is obligated to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. Per our siding argument, mismatched siding reduces value and fails to meet claim requirements .\nQ130: Carrier says: \n“We’ll paint siding to match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPainting voids warranty and fades differently than factory siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested painting new siding to match. Per our siding argument, painting siding voids manufacturer warranty and fades unevenly compared to factory finish. This is not a valid repair. Replacement is required .\nQ131: Question: \nWhen should the Estimate Request Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when insurance estimate omits items or underpays scope .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Estimate Request Template is used whenever the insurance estimate is incomplete — missing items like flashing, underlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .\nQ132: Adjuster says: \n“Our estimate is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence requires revision — outlined in\nunderlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .\nQ132: Adjuster says: \n“Our estimate is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence requires revision — outlined in Estimate Request Template .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said the estimate is final. The Estimate Request Template provides standardized language to show new documentation (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires revision of your estimate. We respectfully request corrections .\nQ133: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for code compliance.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template cites VA/MD code upgrades .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied code items. The Estimate Request Template language cites specific state codes, such as Maryland Code R703 (WRB) and VA Code 908.5 (flashing). These are not optional — they are code requirements that must be included .\nQ134: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is your estimate higher than insurance’s?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe include all code-required and manufacturer-required items .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nOur estimate may be higher because it includes all code-required upgrades and manufacturer-required components that insurance sometimes leaves out. The Estimate Request Template is how we push back to ensure these are included .\nQ135: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t pay for underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires new underlayment; reusing voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF installation standards, new underlayment must be installed when reroofing. Reusing underlayment voids warranty. The Estimate Request Template language requests this correction .\nQ136: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFlashing replacement required by VA Code 908.5 .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, all damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced when reroofing. This is a code requirement, not optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n“We priced shingles too low.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom\nnot optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n“We priced shingles too low.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nThe shingle pricing in your estimate is below current market value. The Estimate Request Template provides language to request market-appropriate pricing corrections. This ensures the claim reflects actual replacement costs .\nQ138: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did insurance’s estimate leave items out?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarriers often omit code/manufacturer items — we use Estimate Request Template to fix .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nInsurance estimates frequently omit items like drip edge, flashing, or WRB. These omissions reduce the payout. We use the Estimate Request Template to point out and correct these errors so the homeowner receives full coverage .\nQ139: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for WRB.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded WRB. Per Maryland Code R703, siding must include a water-resistive barrier. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement and requests correction .\nQ140: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for ridge vent.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vents must be removed for slope replacement; new required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing slopes and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template requests this correction .\nQ141: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for drip edge.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIRC requires drip edge at eaves and rakes .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded drip edge. Per the IRC adopted in Virginia, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement for correction .\nQ142: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to send estimate corrections?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCorrections ensure code compliance and fair market value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe send estimate corrections to ensure all code-required items and market-appropriate pricing are included. Without corrections, homeowners are left with underfunded claims. The Estimate Request Template makes these corrections formal .\nQ\nfair market value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe send estimate corrections to ensure all code-required items and market-appropriate pricing are included. Without corrections, homeowners are left with underfunded claims. The Estimate Request Template makes these corrections formal .\nQ143: Adjuster says: \n“Your corrections aren’t valid.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCorrections are backed by manufacturer guidelines and state code .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve rejected our corrections. The Estimate Request Template is based on manufacturer requirements and building code citations. These are not optional suggestions; they are mandatory. Corrections must be made .\nQ144: Carrier says: \n“Your estimate inflates costs.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur estimate includes only code and manufacturer-required items .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our estimate inflates costs. In reality, our estimate includes only what is required by building code and manufacturer standards. The Estimate Request Template ensures we justify these inclusions .\nQ145: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover valley flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code 908.5 requires flashing replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded valley flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during reroofing. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement .\nQ146: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for chimney flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIRC requires flashing at all penetrations .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded chimney flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing is required at all penetrations, including chimneys. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\nQ147: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t pay for skylight flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSkylight flashing must be replaced when roof is replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations. Skylight flashing cannot be reused and must be replaced. The Estimate Request Template addresses this correction .\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it\n.\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it eliminates subjectivity. Carriers cannot deny items required by law. The Estimate Request Template ensures each correction is supported by code .\nQ149: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires starter strips at eaves/rakes for wind warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind warranty. The Estimate Request Template ensures these are included .\nQ150: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover ridge caps.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge caps must be replaced when slopes are replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\nQ151: Question: \nWhen should the iTel Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when shingles/siding are discontinued and repairs would cause mismatches .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe iTel Template is used whenever a carrier suggests patching, but iTel testing confirms the shingles or siding are discontinued. By citing iTel’s lab analysis and the Discontinued Shingle List, it proves no suitable replacement exists and full replacement is required .\nQ152: Adjuster says: \n“We found similar shingles available.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirmed no match exists; mixing voids manufacturer warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested similar shingles are available. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued with no acceptable match. Installing mismatched shingles violates manufacturer warranty and reduces property value. Full replacement is required .\nQ153: Carrier says: \n“Metric shingles can replace English dimension.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMetric and English shingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent\nshingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent proper sealant alignment. This misalignment voids warranty and fails to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ154: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just mix old and new shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant alignment .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nMixing discontinued shingles with new ones creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant placement. These differences compromise wind resistance and void manufacturer warranty. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms no compatible products are available .\nQ155: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll only replace damaged shingles, not full slope.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirms discontinued; partial replacement isn’t possible .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed replacing only visibly damaged shingles. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued. Since replacements cannot match, partial repairs would be defective. Full slope replacement is the only solution .\nQ156: Carrier says: \n“We can still patch siding with a close match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nClose match isn’t acceptable; iTel confirms discontinued siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested patching siding with a close match. The iTel analysis confirms the siding is discontinued and no match exists. Mismatched siding reduces property value and violates Maryland matching regulations .\nQ157: Homeowner asks: \n“What is an iTel report?”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel is a lab test confirming material type and availability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAn iTel report is a laboratory analysis of a material sample (shingle, siding, etc.). It confirms product type, manufacturer, and whether it is still available. If discontinued, it provides written proof repairs are not feasible .\nQ158: Carrier says: \n“We don’t accept iTel reports.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel is independent lab analysis widely accepted in the industry .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and\nwidely accepted in the industry .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and provide objective proof of discontinuation .\nQ159: Adjuster says: \n“Shingles look available at Home Depot.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRetail stores don’t confirm compatibility; iTel confirms discontinuation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated similar shingles appear in retail stores. Availability at retail does not guarantee dimensional compatibility. The iTel report confirms the original shingles are discontinued and no suitable match exists .\nQ160: Homeowner asks: \n“Why does discontinued matter if roof still works?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued means no repairs possible without mismatching .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf shingles are discontinued, no replacements match in size, color, or sealant alignment. This makes repairs impossible without mismatching. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms when a roof system can no longer be patched, requiring full replacement .\nQ161: Carrier says: \n“We’ll approve repair, not replacement, despite iTel.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel proves repairs impossible; replacement is required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved repair despite iTel findings. The iTel report proves the product is discontinued, making repairs impossible without mismatches. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ162: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll blend different shingle lots.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLot variations cause color mismatch; iTel confirms no true match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested blending different lots of shingles. Lot variations cause visible color mismatches, and per the iTel report, the original shingles are discontinued. No blending can restore uniformity. Full replacement is required .\nQ163: Carrier says: \n“Discontinued list isn’t proof.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued list + iTel lab analysis confirm unavailability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t\n’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just re-use old shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOld shingles crack when lifted; repair attempt shows brittleness .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nReusing old shingles isn’t possible because once lifted, they crack or fail to reseal. Our repair attempt video documents brittleness. Combined with discontinued status, reuse is not feasible .\nQ165: Adjuster says: \n“New manufacturer products are close enough.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing brands violates warranty and reduces property value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed using a different manufacturer’s product. Mixing brands voids warranty and creates mismatches in size and color. The iTel report confirms no acceptable alternative exists .\nQ166: Carrier says: \n“We’ll pay for only a few discontinued panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPartial payment ignores irreparability proven by iTel .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve offered to pay for a few discontinued panels. The iTel report proves no matches exist, so partial repairs aren’t feasible. Full replacement is required .\nQ167: Homeowner asks: \n“How does iTel help my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt provides third-party proof repairs aren’t possible .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAn iTel report is powerful because it’s a third-party lab test confirming discontinuation. Insurance companies must consider it credible evidence that repairs are not possible. It directly supports full replacement .\nQ168: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t need third-party verification.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel provides unbiased lab confirmation; not contractor opinion .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed iTel verification. Unlike contractor opinion, iTel is unbiased lab testing. It confirms material discontinuation in an objective, industry-accepted format .\nQ169: Carrier says: \n“We’ll allow repair with different dimensions.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric\nAnswer (with source):\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric sizes do not align, leaving sealant strips misaligned and vulnerable. Repairs are unsafe; full replacement is required .\nQ170: Homeowner asks: \n“Can insurance force me to accept mismatched materials?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — insurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nNo, insurance cannot force mismatched repairs. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding and roofing are not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in policy. You’re entitled to full replacement .\nQ171: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just caulk or seal damaged shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCaulking is not manufacturer-approved repair; voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed caulking damaged shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, caulking is not an approved repair method and voids warranty. Replacement is required .\nQ172: Carrier says: \n“We won’t accept discontinued list as evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued list + iTel confirm no replacement available .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. When paired with iTel lab testing, the Discontinued Shingle List confirms no suitable replacement is available. Together, they provide conclusive proof .\nQ173: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens if we can’t match?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode and regulations require full replacement when mismatching .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf a match isn’t possible, full replacement is required. Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 confirms that mismatched siding or roofing isn’t acceptable unless excluded in the policy .\nQ174: Adjuster says: \n“We can reuse discontinued shingles from repair stock.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStored shingles won’t align in color/age; still discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested using repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\nQ175: Carrier says:\nusing repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\nQ175: Carrier says: \n“We’ll patch siding with leftover stock.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLeftover siding won’t match aged/weathered walls; iTel confirms discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested using leftover siding stock. These pieces won’t match weathered siding on the home, and the iTel report confirms the line is discontinued. Patching with leftovers does not restore pre-loss condition .\nQ176: Question: \nWhen should the Arbitration Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier denies all appeals and homeowner seeks neutral review .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Arbitration Template should be used when all internal appeals with the insurance company have been exhausted and the carrier maintains denial. It initiates a neutral review process where an arbitrator evaluates the dispute. This forces the carrier to defend their denial against documented evidence .\nQ177: Carrier says: \n“Denial is final and not appealable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is a valid escalation option under policy rights .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the denial is final. Per the Arbitration Information template, the policyholder maintains the right to escalate unresolved disputes through arbitration. This process ensures fair claim handling beyond internal review .\nQ178: Homeowner asks: \n“What is arbitration?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is a neutral third-party review of the claim .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nArbitration is when a neutral third-party arbitrator reviews the evidence from both sides — homeowner and carrier — and makes a binding or advisory decision. It’s an escalation step if the carrier refuses to honor valid claim documentation .\nQ179: Carrier says: \n“Arbitration doesn’t apply here.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIf policy includes arbitration, carrier must participate .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration. If the policy includes arbitration provisions, the carrier must participate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and\nparticipate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and still binding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nArbitration avoids the delays and costs of lawsuits while still offering neutral review. It’s faster, more affordable, and often binding depending on policy terms. The Arbitration Template helps initiate this option effectively .\nQ181: Question: \nWhen should Complaint Forms be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier mishandles claim or refuses fair handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nComplaint Forms should be used when an insurance company delays, denies, or mishandles a claim unfairly. Filing with the state insurance administration creates oversight and pressures carriers to comply with fair claims practices .\nQ182: Carrier says: \n“State complaints won’t change our decision.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints trigger regulatory oversight carriers must respond to .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints won’t matter. Filing a state complaint forces regulatory oversight. Carriers must respond to the state authority, creating accountability in claim handling .\nQ183: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens after I file a complaint?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe state reviews carrier actions and demands formal response .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAfter you file a complaint, the state insurance administration reviews the carrier’s handling of your claim. The carrier must provide a formal written response. This often leads to claim reconsideration .\nQ184: Adjuster says: \n“Complaints are just paperwork.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints document mishandling and force carrier accountability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed complaints as meaningless. In fact, complaints document mishandling and force accountability under state oversight. Carriers must provide a formal justification, often leading to fairer outcomes .\nQ185: Homeowner asks: \n“Will filing a complaint hurt my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — it enforces fair handling and protects your rights .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\nQ186: Carrier says: \n“We don’t recognize\nTraining Draft):\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\nQ186: Carrier says: \n“We don’t recognize state complaints.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarriers are required by law to respond to complaints .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t recognize state complaints. By law, carriers must respond to oversight inquiries. Filing a Complaint Form compels this response and ensures review of claim handling .\nQ187: Question: \nWhen should both Arbitration and Complaint Forms be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier refuses reconsideration and claim is unresolved .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nBoth Arbitration and Complaint Forms should be used when a carrier refuses reconsideration despite documentation. Arbitration applies policy provisions for neutral review, while complaints trigger state oversight. Together, they maximize pressure for resolution .\nQ188: Homeowner asks: \n“Which should I do first: arbitration or complaint?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaint first for oversight; arbitration if still unresolved .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nGenerally, filing a complaint first is recommended because it creates regulatory oversight. If the carrier still refuses, then proceed to arbitration. Both paths are valid, but this order applies the most pressure .\nQ189: Carrier says: \n“We won’t change claim regardless of oversight.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOversight and arbitration hold carriers accountable by law .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated oversight won’t affect your decision. State regulators and arbitration provisions exist specifically to hold carriers accountable. Ignoring either is a violation of fair claim handling .\nQ190: Homeowner asks: \n“Do many people file complaints?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nYes — complaints are common and effective for unfair denials .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nYes, many homeowners file complaints when claims are unfairly denied or delayed. The Complaint Form process is standard and often leads to faster, fairer resolution .\nQ191: Carrier says: \n“We won’t respond to arbitration.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPolicy provisions require participation once initiated .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\nrequire participation once initiated .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\nQ192: Adjuster says: \n“Arbitration is just advisory.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMany arbitration decisions are binding per policy terms .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said arbitration is advisory only. Many policies make arbitration binding. Even when advisory, arbitrators’ decisions strongly influence resolution. The Arbitration Template enforces this right .\nQ193: Homeowner asks: \n“What if complaint doesn’t work?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nProceed to arbitration or escalate legally .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf a complaint doesn’t resolve the issue, the next step is arbitration or legal escalation. Complaints create oversight, but arbitration provides binding or advisory resolution if denial persists .\nQ194: Carrier says: \n“Customer has no further rights.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCustomer has right to complaint, arbitration, and legal action .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the customer has no further rights. In fact, policyholders maintain the right to complaints, arbitration, and legal remedies. Denying these rights is a violation of fair claims practices .\nQ195: Homeowner asks: \n“Is complaint filing complicated?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — forms are simple and Roof-ER provides guidance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFiling a complaint is straightforward. The forms are simple, and Roof-ER provides the homeowner with templates and step-by-step guidance. The Complaint Forms make the process efficient .\nQ196: Adjuster says: \n“Complaints waste time.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints are official state action carriers must respond to .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints waste time. In reality, complaints initiate state action that requires a carrier response. They are a valid escalation and often change claim outcomes .\nQ197: Carrier says: \n“Arbitration is too costly.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster and cheaper than litigation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration as costly. Arbitration is significantly faster and cheaper than litigation for both sides. It’s a valid escalation provided in\n):\nArbitration is faster and cheaper than litigation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration as costly. Arbitration is significantly faster and cheaper than litigation for both sides. It’s a valid escalation provided in many policies .\nQ198: Homeowner asks: \n“Will Roof-ER help with complaints/arbitration?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nYes — Roof-ER provides templates and guidance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nYes, Roof-ER supports homeowners through both complaints and arbitration. We provide templates, documentation, and coaching so customers can file confidently. The Arbitration and Complaint Forms are designed to make this process easy .\nQ199: Carrier says: \n“Complaints don’t prove storm damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints enforce fair handling, not damage proof .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints don’t prove damage. That is correct — complaints enforce fair handling of claims. Damage proof comes from repair attempts, iTel, and photo reports. Complaints ensure carriers treat this documentation fairly .\nQ200: Homeowner asks: \n“What’s the final step if all else fails?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLegal escalation is last resort after complaint/arbitration .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf both complaints and arbitration fail, the final step is legal escalation. Roof-ER can provide documentation and guidance, but attorneys handle this stage. Arbitration and complaints usually resolve issues before legal action is needed .",

    "content": "Insurance Pushback & Arguments Playbook (Q1–Q100)\nQ1: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see enough damage to warrant replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report shows functional storm damage (creases, missing shingles) beyond repair. This requires full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nPlease see the attached photo report documenting storm-related damage on multiple slopes. The photos clearly show creased and missing shingles, which are consistent with functional wind damage and cannot be repaired without causing further harm. Per standard industry practice, this constitutes irreparability, and a full replacement is required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. We respectfully request that your estimate be revised accordingly .\nQ2: Adjuster says: \n“Hail is cosmetic and doesn’t affect function.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHail damage is not cosmetic — it causes granule loss, mat fractures, and sealant bond failures, per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states that hail damage is cosmetic only. However, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, hail impact causes functional issues such as granule loss, cracks in the asphalt mat, and compromised sealant bonds. These defects accelerate roof deterioration and shorten lifespan, making the roof irreparable. For these reasons, this damage cannot be dismissed as cosmetic. Please update your estimate to reflect full roof replacement .\nQ3: Carrier says: \n“Shingles can be patched.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued; patching would cause mismatches and fail manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour position that the roof can be patched is not consistent with the findings of the attached iTel report, which confirms that the installed shingles are discontinued. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, no comparable replacements exist. Mixing discontinued shingles with available alternatives creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant bond, violating manufacturer standards. The only viable and code-compliant option is full replacement .\nQ4: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see storm-related damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the\nphoto report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the attached photo report, which documents collateral impacts to gutters, soft metals, and shingles. These damage patterns are consistent with the storm event reported and align with industry-recognized storm signatures. Additionally, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, latent damage from wind or hail may not be visible immediately but still compromises long-term performance. We ask that the scope be reconsidered with this evidence in mind .\nQ5: Carrier says: \n“The roof is still functional.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCoverage isn’t based on functionality — cracked shingles and exposed mats void warranties and require replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nWhile you noted the roof is “still functional,” coverage is not determined by whether a roof is currently leaking but by restoring the property to its pre-loss condition. The attached documentation shows cracked shingles and exposed fiberglass mats. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, these conditions void the manufacturer’s warranty and compromise the integrity of the system. Repair is not feasible, and replacement is required to bring the property back to pre-storm condition .\nQ6: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover storm tarp nail holes.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer GAF, tarping through shingles permanently damages them. Caulking nail holes is not an acceptable repair .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes coverage for tarp-related nail holes. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, any roof that has been nailed through during tarping has been permanently compromised. Caulking these penetrations is not a permanent repair and creates a maintenance issue outside warranty coverage. The shingles with nail holes must be replaced to ensure a watertight system .\nQ7: Carrier says: \n“Damage is old, not storm-related.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur timestamped photo report shows fresh granule loss and collateral consistent with the reported storm .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests the roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized\nthe roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized and patterned. These conditions confirm storm-related damage .\nQ8: Adjuster says: \n“Denial stands, no additional inspection.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe homeowner may request a second inspection and has provided new documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nWe respectfully request a second inspection on behalf of the homeowner. The customer-to-insurance template letter has been provided and highlights overlooked damage supported by our documentation. Denying reinspection ignores the policyholder’s right to fair claim handling. Please reconsider based on this new evidence .\nQ9: Carrier says: \n“No damage to soft metals = no hail event.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report shows dents in metals. Even without collateral, GAF confirms hail causes latent shingle damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou denied hail damage based on an absence of collateral. The attached photo report shows visible dents to soft metals. Furthermore, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, shingles can sustain latent damage (fractures, granule loss, bond failures) even without collateral evidence. The absence of extensive metal damage does not rule out functional hail damage to shingles .\nQ10: Adjuster says: \n“Your test was unnecessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is industry standard. Our video shows shingles cracked during manipulation, proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nOur brittle test was necessary to confirm whether repair was feasible. The documented repair attempt video shows the shingles fractured during manipulation, a clear indicator of irreparability. This aligns with accepted industry standards for testing storm-damaged shingles. Repair is not possible; full replacement is the only solution .\nQ11: Carrier says: \n“Your documentation isn’t sufficient.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe’ve provided photo report, repair attempt, and iTel report — proving irreparability and discontinuation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:\nA photo report showing storm-related damage.\n\nA repair attempt video proving irreparability.\n\nAn iTel report confirming discontinuation of the sh\n(Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:\nA photo report showing storm-related damage.\n\nA repair attempt video proving irreparability.\n\nAn iTel report confirming discontinuation of the shingles.\n\n Together, these documents establish that the roof cannot be repaired, only replaced .\n\nQ12: Adjuster says: \n“The roof is patchable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing discontinued English-dimension shingles with metric shingles misaligns sealant, violating manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests patching is possible. The attached iTel report confirms the existing shingles are English dimension and discontinued. New shingles are only available in metric sizing, which misaligns sealant strips and prevents proper bonding. Manufacturer installation standards prohibit mixing dimensions, making patching non-viable .\nQ13: Carrier says: \n“No coverage for siding mismatch.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 requires siding replacement unless policy explicitly excludes it .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial of siding mismatch coverage contradicts Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, which requires carriers to provide for siding replacement unless policies specifically exclude matching. The damaged siding is discontinued, and no suitable matches are available. Full elevation replacement is required .\nQ14: Adjuster says: \n“We only pay Actual Cash Value, not replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nReplacement cost policies require restoring pre-loss condition. Patch repairs with discontinued shingles don’t qualify .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve indicated coverage is limited to ACV only. This property carries replacement cost coverage, which requires restoring it to pre-loss condition. Since the shingles are discontinued, patch repairs are impossible without mismatching and lowering value. Full replacement is the only way to honor policy terms .\nQ15: Carrier says: \n“No hail large enough reported.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNOAA data and our photos show functional hail damage. Size is irrelevant once damage exists .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial cites no reported hail size sufficient for damage. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .\n. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .\nQ16: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during re-roofing .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code 908.5, all rusted, damaged, or deteriorated flashings must be replaced when re-roofing. Attempting to reuse old flashings violates code and creates long-term risk. Replacement must be included .\nQ17: Carrier says: \n“Granule loss is normal aging.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF states storm-related granule loss exposes asphalt and accelerates failure .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial attributes granule loss to aging. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granule loss from hail or wind exposes the asphalt mat, accelerating deterioration and causing premature failure. This is storm-related functional damage, not normal wear .\nQ18: Adjuster says: \n“Repairs will hold fine.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur repair attempt already failed — shingles cracked during manipulation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated repairs will hold. However, our documented repair attempt shows shingles cracking when lifted, confirming brittleness. Repairs would cause further damage and are not viable. Replacement is required .\nQ19: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for collateral damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) proves storm impact and supports full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes collateral. Our photo report documents storm-related impacts to gutters, metals, and siding. Collateral damage proves storm impact, strengthens the claim, and requires coverage to restore the property fully .\nQ20: Adjuster says: \n“Denial is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHomeowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer\nowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer resolution at this stage and urge reconsideration with the new documentation provided .\nQ21: Carrier says: \n“We don’t accept contractor reports.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur iTel and photo reports are third-party verified industry standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated contractor reports are insufficient. Please note, the iTel report is a third-party laboratory analysis, and our photo report follows standard claim documentation procedures. These are accepted industry documents and valid evidence of storm damage .\nQ22: Adjuster says: \n“We see no storm date evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur report is timestamped and consistent with NOAA storm data .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial cites no storm date evidence. Our photo report is timestamped and aligns with NOAA storm data for this location and date. The pattern and extent of the damage confirm storm causation .\nQ23: Carrier says: \n“Your estimate exceeds fair market value.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur estimate includes mandatory code items like flashing and WRB per VA & MD code .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our estimate exceeds market value. Please note the estimate includes mandatory code items: flashing per VA Code 908.5 and water-resistive barriers per MD Code R703. These are required by law and must be included in the scope .\nQ24: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires underlayment to overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6″. Reuse isn’t allowed .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes underlayment. Per GAF Slope Replacement Guidelines, when replacing a single plane, underlayment must overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6 inches. Reusing old material is not permitted, and proper installation requires new underlayment .\nQ25: Carrier says: \n“We won’t reopen this claim.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the\n: Carrier says: \n“We won’t reopen this claim.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the claim cannot be reopened. However, we’ve provided new documentation: a repair attempt video confirming irreparability, an iTel report verifying discontinuation, and a photo report documenting storm damage. This new evidence requires reconsideration under the policyholder’s rights .\nQ26: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll replace the back slope only, not the entire roof.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer GAF slope replacement requirements, underlayment and ridge/hip work cannot be isolated — full replacement is required .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only the back slope for replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, replacing a single slope requires removing and overlapping underlayment at ridge and hip connections, which compromises adjoining slopes. This process makes isolated slope replacement impractical and risks system failure. A full replacement is required to maintain roof integrity .\nQ27: Carrier says: \n“We only saw damage on the front slope.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStorms impact all slopes. Our photo report shows consistent collateral across multiple slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour approval of only the front slope does not reflect the actual storm damage. Our attached photo report documents consistent collateral and shingle damage across multiple slopes. Storm exposure is not limited to a single elevation. To restore the property, all slopes must be included .\nQ28: Adjuster says: \n“Only one siding elevation is covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland law requires full replacement when matching is impossible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only one elevation for siding replacement. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in the policy. The damaged siding is discontinued, and matching is impossible. Full elevation replacement is required .\nQ29: Carrier says: \n“We don’t see gutter damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows collateral gutter impacts consistent with roof damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial omits gutters. Our photo report documents dents and granule washout in the gutters consistent with roof storm damage. Collateral gutter damage confirms storm\nwith roof damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial omits gutters. Our photo report documents dents and granule washout in the gutters consistent with roof storm damage. Collateral gutter damage confirms storm impact and must be included in the scope .\nQ30: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover downspouts.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDownspouts show hail dents and granule buildup. They are storm-damaged and must be replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes downspouts. Our attached photo documentation shows clear hail dents and granule buildup at downspout terminations. These are storm-related damages that shorten system life. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ31: Carrier says: \n“We’ll approve roof but not siding.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStorm caused both roof and siding damage. Code and matching requirements apply .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved roof replacement but denied siding. The storm impacted both systems. Per our siding argument documentation and Maryland matching requirements, partial siding replacement creates mismatches and fails to restore the home properly. Siding must be included .\nQ32: Adjuster says: \n“Only approving half of siding wall.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRemoving corner posts requires detaching full wall, causing consequential damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve limited siding replacement to half a wall. Per our siding argument documentation, removing corner posts and reinstalling panels causes consequential damage that requires full wall replacement. Partial approval is not feasible .\nQ33: Carrier says: \n“We only cover wind-damaged shingles, not hail.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report documents both hail and wind impacts; both require coverage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve covered wind damage but excluded hail. The attached photo report documents both creased shingles (wind) and circular divots with granule loss (hail). Per GAF Storm Guidelines, hail damage is functional, not cosmetic. Both perils must be covered .\nQ34: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code requires flashing replacement when deteriorated or rusted .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code\n: \n“We’ll cover roof but not flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code requires flashing replacement when deteriorated or rusted .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code 908.5, any rusted, damaged, or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during reroofing. Code compliance requires flashing be included in the scope .\nQ35: Carrier says: \n“No siding wrap needed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Code R703 requires WRB behind siding .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded housewrap. Per Maryland Exterior Wall Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting this violates code and risks moisture intrusion. WRB must be included .\nQ36: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover slope but not ridge cap.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nReplacing a slope requires ridge cap removal; reuse voids manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved slope replacement but excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed during slope replacement and cannot be reinstalled without voiding warranty. Ridge caps must be included .\nQ37: Carrier says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires new underlayment overlap when replacing slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF technical bulletin TAB-R-164, when replacing a slope, underlayment must extend 4–6 inches into adjoining slopes. Reuse is prohibited. Underlayment replacement is required .\nQ38: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll only replace one plane of siding.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode requires WRB overlap across corners; partial wall replacement isn’t feasible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve limited siding replacement to one plane. Per Maryland Code R703, WRB must overlap 6 inches at joints and corners, which requires removal of adjacent siding. Partial replacement is not feasible and violates code .\nQ39: Carrier says: \n“We won’t cover ventilation removal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires ridge ventilation be removed when adjoining slopes are replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes ventilation. Per GAF Slo\nsays: \n“We won’t cover ventilation removal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires ridge ventilation be removed when adjoining slopes are replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes ventilation. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing adjoining slopes. They cannot be reused without risking water intrusion. Ventilation must be included .\nQ40: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for drip edge.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInternational Residential Code requires drip edge at eaves and rakes for asphalt shingles .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded drip edge. Per the Virginia adopted IRC, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes on asphalt shingle installations. This is a code-mandated component and must be included .\nQ41: Carrier says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not valley metal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code requires valley flashing be replaced when deteriorated .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes valley flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, deteriorated flashing, including valleys, must be replaced when reroofing. Valley metal must be included in scope .\nQ42: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover slope but not hip shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHip shingles must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reinstalled .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved slope replacement but excluded hips. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, hip shingles must be removed when adjoining slopes are replaced. They cannot be reused; new hip shingles are required .\nQ43: Carrier says: \n“Only slope replacement, no ice/water shield.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIce/water shield required at eaves in snow-prone areas per IRC .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied ice/water shield. Per the IRC as adopted in Virginia, ice barrier underlayment is required at eaves in regions subject to ice dams. This must be included for code compliance .\nQ44: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover ridge vent replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vents must be removed for adjoining slope work and cannot be reused .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope\ncover ridge vent replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vents must be removed for adjoining slope work and cannot be reused .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed during adjoining slope replacement. Reuse compromises performance and violates manufacturer instructions. Ridge vent replacement must be included .\nQ45: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nManufacturer guidelines require starter strips on eaves and rakes for wind warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF installation standards, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind resistance warranty coverage. Starter shingles are a mandatory component .\nQ46: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover ridge caps because they look fine.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge caps must be removed when slopes are replaced; reinstallation voids coverage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed to install new underlayment and shingles. Once removed, they cannot be reused without voiding warranty. New ridge caps must be included .\nQ47: Carrier says: \n“We don’t cover step flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code requires replacement of damaged flashing during reroofing .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes step flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, existing flashings that are rusted, damaged, or deteriorated must be replaced when reroofing. Step flashing is integral and cannot be reused .\nQ48: Adjuster says: \n“Only covering roof plane, not chimney flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode requires flashing at all penetrations; chimney flashing must be replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded chimney flashing. Per IRC R703.4 as adopted in Maryland, flashing must be installed at all penetrations to prevent water entry. Chimney flashing replacement is required for compliance .\nQ49: Carrier says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not fascia metal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral fascia dents documented in photo report prove storm damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded fasc\nCarrier says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not fascia metal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral fascia dents documented in photo report prove storm damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded fascia metal. Our attached photo report shows dents and creasing consistent with storm impact. Collateral damage must be included for proper restoration .\nQ50: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover skylight flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFlashing at penetrations must be replaced per code; skylights cannot be reused with old flashing .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations to prevent water intrusion. Skylight flashing cannot be reused once disturbed and must be replaced to maintain watertightness .\nQ51: Adjuster says: \n“We can repair by lifting shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur repair attempt video shows shingles cracked during lifting — proving brittleness .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested repairs by lifting shingles. We attempted this, and the repair attempt video shows shingles cracking and breaking when lifted. This confirms brittleness and irreparability. Replacement is the only feasible option to restore the property .\nQ52: Carrier says: \n“Try a patch first.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPatch test failed — new shingles don’t align with existing sealant strips .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial requests a patch attempt. We attempted repair, and the shingles fractured upon manipulation. Further, per the iTel report, the existing shingles are discontinued and English dimension, while replacements are metric. This creates misaligned sealant strips and voids manufacturer warranty. Repairs are not possible .\nQ53: Adjuster says: \n“You didn’t prove repair wasn’t possible.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempt caused more damage — documented in video .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated we did not prove repairs impossible. Our repair attempt video shows that when shingles were lifted, they tore and fractured. This damage is conclusive evidence of irreparability. Replacement is required .\nQ54: Carrier says: \n“Repairs will be minor.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven minor repairs cracked shingles, confirming brit\nlifted, they tore and fractured. This damage is conclusive evidence of irreparability. Replacement is required .\nQ54: Carrier says: \n“Repairs will be minor.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven minor repairs cracked shingles, confirming brittleness .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests only minor repairs are needed. We attempted such repairs, and even slight lifting of shingles caused cracking. This proves brittleness and irreparability. Minor repairs are not an option .\nQ55: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll repair siding with a panel swap.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRemoving siding panels damages adjoining ones, requiring full wall replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou proposed repairing siding by swapping panels. Per our siding argument documentation, removing individual panels requires detaching corner posts and adjoining panels, causing consequential damage. This makes partial repair infeasible. Full replacement is required .\nQ56: Carrier says: \n“Corner post removal is simple.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRemoving corner posts causes consequential siding damage per siding repair standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested corner post removal is minor. In reality, per our siding argument, removing corner posts necessitates detaching full wall sections of siding. This process causes consequential damage and makes simple repairs impossible .\nQ57: Adjuster says: \n“We can reuse siding panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSiding panels distort and crack when removed, making reuse impossible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated siding panels can be reused. However, per our siding argument documentation, panels crack and distort when removed due to interlocking mechanisms. Reuse compromises fit and watertightness. Replacement is required .\nQ58: Carrier says: \n“Repair attempt wasn’t needed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard to confirm irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair tests are industry standard to confirm whether patching is possible. Our attempt caused additional shingle damage, proving irreparability. Replacement is justified .\nQ59: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll approve repair of flashing only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStep and counter flashing cannot be removed without damaging siding/roof .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve\n.\nQ59: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll approve repair of flashing only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStep and counter flashing cannot be removed without damaging siding/roof .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved flashing repair only. Per VA code and flashing installation requirements, step and counter flashing are integrated into siding and roof coverings. They cannot be removed or repaired without causing consequential damage. Full replacement is necessary .\nQ60: Carrier says: \n“We’ll approve spot shingle replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSpot repairs cracked shingles and failed brittle test .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests spot shingle replacement. Our repair attempt shows that individual shingle replacement caused additional cracking. Spot repair failed brittle testing and is not feasible. Full slope replacement is required .\nQ61: Adjuster says: \n“Metal roof can be spot repaired.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMetal panels interlock; removal damages adjoining panels .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated metal roofing can be spot repaired. Per our photo documentation, metal panels interlock, and removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing distortion. Spot repair is not feasible; replacement is necessary .\nQ62: Carrier says: \n“Flat roof can be patched.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPatching violates manufacturer warranty; full system integrity is required .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested patching the flat roof.

Per the IRC and state-adopted codes in Virginia and Maryland, reroofing requires drip edge, flashing replacement, weather barriers, and underlayment. These items are mandatory and must be included to bring the property into compliance .\nInsurance Pushback & Arguments Playbook (Q1–Q100)\nQ1: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see enough damage to warrant replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report shows functional storm damage (creases, missing shingles) beyond repair. This requires full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nPlease see the attached photo report documenting storm-related damage on multiple slopes. The photos clearly show creased and missing shingles, which are consistent with functional wind damage and cannot be repaired without causing further harm. Per standard industry practice, this constitutes irreparability, and a full replacement is required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. We respectfully request that your estimate be revised accordingly .\nQ2: Adjuster says: \n“Hail is cosmetic and doesn’t affect function.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHail damage is not cosmetic — it causes granule loss, mat fractures, and sealant bond failures, per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states that hail damage is cosmetic only. However, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, hail impact causes functional issues such as granule loss, cracks in the asphalt mat, and compromised sealant bonds. These defects accelerate roof deterioration and shorten lifespan, making the roof irreparable. For these reasons, this damage cannot be dismissed as cosmetic. Please update your estimate to reflect full roof replacement .\nQ3: Carrier says: \n“Shingles can be patched.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued; patching would cause mismatches and fail manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour position that the roof can be patched is not consistent with the findings of the attached iTel report, which confirms that the installed shingles are discontinued. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, no comparable replacements exist. Mixing discontinued shingles with available alternatives creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant bond, violating manufacturer standards. The only viable and code-compliant option is full replacement .\nQ4: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see storm-related damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the\nphoto report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the attached photo report, which documents collateral impacts to gutters, soft metals, and shingles. These damage patterns are consistent with the storm event reported and align with industry-recognized storm signatures. Additionally, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, latent damage from wind or hail may not be visible immediately but still compromises long-term performance. We ask that the scope be reconsidered with this evidence in mind .\nQ5: Carrier says: \n“The roof is still functional.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCoverage isn’t based on functionality — cracked shingles and exposed mats void warranties and require replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nWhile you noted the roof is “still functional,” coverage is not determined by whether a roof is currently leaking but by restoring the property to its pre-loss condition. The attached documentation shows cracked shingles and exposed fiberglass mats. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, these conditions void the manufacturer’s warranty and compromise the integrity of the system. Repair is not feasible, and replacement is required to bring the property back to pre-storm condition .\nQ6: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover storm tarp nail holes.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer GAF, tarping through shingles permanently damages them. Caulking nail holes is not an acceptable repair .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes coverage for tarp-related nail holes. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, any roof that has been nailed through during tarping has been permanently compromised. Caulking these penetrations is not a permanent repair and creates a maintenance issue outside warranty coverage. The shingles with nail holes must be replaced to ensure a watertight system .\nQ7: Carrier says: \n“Damage is old, not storm-related.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur timestamped photo report shows fresh granule loss and collateral consistent with the reported storm .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests the roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized\nthe roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized and patterned. These conditions confirm storm-related damage .\nQ8: Adjuster says: \n“Denial stands, no additional inspection.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe homeowner may request a second inspection and has provided new documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nWe respectfully request a second inspection on behalf of the homeowner. The customer-to-insurance template letter has been provided and highlights overlooked damage supported by our documentation. Denying reinspection ignores the policyholder’s right to fair claim handling. Please reconsider based on this new evidence .\nQ9: Carrier says: \n“No damage to soft metals = no hail event.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report shows dents in metals. Even without collateral, GAF confirms hail causes latent shingle damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou denied hail damage based on an absence of collateral. The attached photo report shows visible dents to soft metals. Furthermore, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, shingles can sustain latent damage (fractures, granule loss, bond failures) even without collateral evidence. The absence of extensive metal damage does not rule out functional hail damage to shingles .\nQ10: Adjuster says: \n“Your test was unnecessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is industry standard. Our video shows shingles cracked during manipulation, proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nOur brittle test was necessary to confirm whether repair was feasible. The documented repair attempt video shows the shingles fractured during manipulation, a clear indicator of irreparability. This aligns with accepted industry standards for testing storm-damaged shingles. Repair is not possible; full replacement is the only solution .\nQ11: Carrier says: \n“Your documentation isn’t sufficient.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe’ve provided photo report, repair attempt, and iTel report — proving irreparability and discontinuation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:\nA photo report showing storm-related damage.\n\nA repair attempt video proving irreparability.\n\nAn iTel report confirming discontinuation of the sh\n(Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:\nA photo report showing storm-related damage.\n\nA repair attempt video proving irreparability.\n\nAn iTel report confirming discontinuation of the shingles.\n\n Together, these documents establish that the roof cannot be repaired, only replaced .\n\nQ12: Adjuster says: \n“The roof is patchable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing discontinued English-dimension shingles with metric shingles misaligns sealant, violating manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests patching is possible. The attached iTel report confirms the existing shingles are English dimension and discontinued. New shingles are only available in metric sizing, which misaligns sealant strips and prevents proper bonding. Manufacturer installation standards prohibit mixing dimensions, making patching non-viable .\nQ13: Carrier says: \n“No coverage for siding mismatch.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 requires siding replacement unless policy explicitly excludes it .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial of siding mismatch coverage contradicts Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, which requires carriers to provide for siding replacement unless policies specifically exclude matching. The damaged siding is discontinued, and no suitable matches are available. Full elevation replacement is required .\nQ14: Adjuster says: \n“We only pay Actual Cash Value, not replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nReplacement cost policies require restoring pre-loss condition. Patch repairs with discontinued shingles don’t qualify .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve indicated coverage is limited to ACV only. This property carries replacement cost coverage, which requires restoring it to pre-loss condition. Since the shingles are discontinued, patch repairs are impossible without mismatching and lowering value. Full replacement is the only way to honor policy terms .\nQ15: Carrier says: \n“No hail large enough reported.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNOAA data and our photos show functional hail damage. Size is irrelevant once damage exists .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial cites no reported hail size sufficient for damage. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .\n. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .\nQ16: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during re-roofing .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code 908.5, all rusted, damaged, or deteriorated flashings must be replaced when re-roofing. Attempting to reuse old flashings violates code and creates long-term risk. Replacement must be included .\nQ17: Carrier says: \n“Granule loss is normal aging.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF states storm-related granule loss exposes asphalt and accelerates failure .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial attributes granule loss to aging. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granule loss from hail or wind exposes the asphalt mat, accelerating deterioration and causing premature failure. This is storm-related functional damage, not normal wear .\nQ18: Adjuster says: \n“Repairs will hold fine.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur repair attempt already failed — shingles cracked during manipulation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated repairs will hold. However, our documented repair attempt shows shingles cracking when lifted, confirming brittleness. Repairs would cause further damage and are not viable. Replacement is required .\nQ19: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for collateral damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) proves storm impact and supports full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes collateral. Our photo report documents storm-related impacts to gutters, metals, and siding. Collateral damage proves storm impact, strengthens the claim, and requires coverage to restore the property fully .\nQ20: Adjuster says: \n“Denial is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHomeowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer\nowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer resolution at this stage and urge reconsideration with the new documentation provided .\nQ21: Carrier says: \n“We don’t accept contractor reports.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur iTel and photo reports are third-party verified industry standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated contractor reports are insufficient. Please note, the iTel report is a third-party laboratory analysis, and our photo report follows standard claim documentation procedures. These are accepted industry documents and valid evidence of storm damage .\nQ22: Adjuster says: \n“We see no storm date evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur report is timestamped and consistent with NOAA storm data .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial cites no storm date evidence. Our photo report is timestamped and aligns with NOAA storm data for this location and date. The pattern and extent of the damage confirm storm causation .\nQ23: Carrier says: \n“Your estimate exceeds fair market value.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur estimate includes mandatory code items like flashing and WRB per VA & MD code .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our estimate exceeds market value. Please note the estimate includes mandatory code items: flashing per VA Code 908.5 and water-resistive barriers per MD Code R703. These are required by law and must be included in the scope .\nQ24: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires underlayment to overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6″. Reuse isn’t allowed .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes underlayment. Per GAF Slope Replacement Guidelines, when replacing a single plane, underlayment must overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6 inches. Reusing old material is not permitted, and proper installation requires new underlayment .\nQ25: Carrier says: \n“We won’t reopen this claim.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the\n: Carrier says: \n“We won’t reopen this claim.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the claim cannot be reopened.

My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that specializes in helping homeowners get their roof replaced, paid for by their insurance!”  \nGeneric:\n“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Philadelphia/Maryland over the past few months that have done a lot of damage! \n“We’re already working with your neighbors. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof  replaced.”\nInitial Pitch\n“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do,  I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nPause here – Wait for them to respond/agree.\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.\nGo in for a handshake. “What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am (your name).  Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I will give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection. (See Inspection and Post-Inspection Script for detailed next steps.)\nInitial Pitch\nBreak into groups\nSwitch between Sales Rep and Homeowner\nRead the script a few times each\nInitial Pitch\nSpecific\n“Were you home for the storm we had in ___. Wait for answer\nIf yes “It was pretty crazy right?! Wait for answer \nIf no: “Oh no worries at all, we get that all the time.\nIf yes move on to next line marked with *\nIf no “That’s good! It was a pretty bad one.”\n*“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof replaced.”\nInitial Pitch Quiz\nWhat are the 5 Non-Negotiables?\nWhat are the first two sentences of the Initial Pitch?\nWhat are the next 2 in the generic script?\nWhat are the next 3 lines if you are mentioning a specific storm date?\nFill in the blanks: “While I’m here in the neighborhood, I am conducting a _____ _____ ____ __ __ __ __ ____ ______, ________damage.\nWhat are the next 2 sentences after they agree to let you do the inspection?\nWhat is the last sentence of the Initial Pitch Script?\nField Portal App\nThe Field Portal App will be used mostly on your phone (but is also useable on your iPad)\nLater on this week, we will review using the Field Portal App on a laptop or desktop which is the most ideal way to keep your jobs organized\nOn the Field Portal App, you can:\nTrack your jobs and what stage they are in\nReview Metrics\nPin houses and create leads\nCreate and upload your Photo reports\nSchedule customer-related events\nReview Tasks and Messages\nCheck the Trade Calendar to see when your installs are going up\nField Portal App\nPinning Houses\nField Portal App\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view a list of your door knocks.\nObjections\nCommon Objections\n“not interested”\n“I need to talk to my spouse”\n“I don’t have enough time”\n“my roof is in good shape”\n“I just had it checked”\n“I don’t have the money for anything right now”\n“I have a roofer knock my door at least 5 times a week”\n“my roof is only 18 years old and is a 50 year roof”\nTips:\nAlways react positively with an agreeable response and attitude\nAsk questions when appropriate\nRepeat the customers’ objections when appropriate\nInitial Pitch\nWork in groups – try to see how much you have memorized\nInitial Pitch\nPlease memorize the whole Generic initial pitch \nPlease also be familiar with the Specific Pitch\nShingles\nDiscontinued Shingles\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bGenerating New Business\nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\nMake it a goal to knock 70 doors minimum per day\nPin the houses\nTake good (quick) notes\nKNOCK SOME MORE\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bInspections\nConduct the inspection in the order of the inspection\nThink about safety\nIf you do not feel safe, DO NOT DO THE INSPECTION\nAlways ensure ladder is safely placed\nSafety items you should consider:\nCougar Paws (Get this before anything else)\nBungee Cords\nPitch Hopper\nOther roofing items – reach out to discuss additional safety items\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bAdjuster Meeting\nAdjuster meeting typically happens within 2 – 7 days\nYou meet with the insurance adjuster\nYou will also be creating your formal photo report this day\nThe decision from the insurance company usually comes within 1 – 10 business days\nOnce a decision is made, they usually only send the estimate to the homeowner\nEnsure the homeowner is prepped to send this to you if the insurance company does not send it to you\nDon’t worry – we will review this in much more detail later – we just want to ensure you understand the timeline at this point\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bProject Meeting\nAfter you send the estimate to Amber (estimates@theroofdocs.com) and to me, we will begin to review the estimate and conduct what is called a Project Review\nWithin a few days, the job will be assigned to one of our Project Coordinators who will schedule a Project Meeting with your homeowner\nThis typically happens within a week of receiving the estimate\nAfter that meeting, the homeowner will sign the Project Documents and submit Downpayment.\nThe Downpayment will typically be the first payment the insurance company sends. This payment is called Actual Cash Value (ACV)\nYou receive $1,000 of the job at Downpayment.\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bInstall and Final Payment\nThe install will typically be scheduled in 4 – 6 weeks from the time that the Homeowner submits Downpayment\nAfter the install is complete, we will schedule a Quality Check and Wrap Up with the homeowner. \nThey will sign the Certificate of Completion here and we will submit this to the insurance company\nThe insurance company will then release the remaining funds.  They call this payment Depreciation.\nThe Homeowner then submits Final Payment.  This payment is a combination of the Depreciation plus their insurance deductible.\nOnce they submit Final Payment, you will receive the remaining 16% of the job.\nThe first 6 weeks, you get 16% of all completed jobs.

How thorough of an inspection you  should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is most important. It doesn’t  matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you don’t have enough damage-photos for  the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim. \nFlashlight\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nKnock on the door \n“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. First I walked around the perimeter of the house  to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the roof.” Say this while going through house number and overview photos \nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story.  Think of us like lawyers and this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof approved.”\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage\nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is circular  in nature.   Even if this  damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these hail divots fill with water, freeze….,  when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance company is responsible and your policy covers this type of damage.” \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. \n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nNow show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts\n“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be what’s protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your roof, it knocks out these granules which reduces the lifespan of your roof.”\nPut phone away\n“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the area”.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when your insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all the damage that I  just showed you.” \n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go get iPad \nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10  Minutes”?\nOnce you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system. Then we can let your insurance company know about the damage”. \nGather information from the homeowner:\nFull name\nAddress\nPhone Number  \nE-mail\nInsurance Company\n“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”! \nAfter you have collected all the information:\nAsk if they have the app or if they have the login to the website. \nIf not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO.  As you are writing or typing the information for the HO to use on the call, explain each part to them.\nAs much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call \nReference Claim Filing Information Sheet\nMove on to Contingency & Claim Authorization\nPost-Inspection Pitch:\u000bAdditional lines if wind damage is present\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage and  anything I have slashed means its wind damage.”\nAfter you go through the lines explaining the hail damage, say:\n“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have (both,) shingles that are creased from the wind lifting them up (and shingles that have completely been blown off.”)\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles\nPost Inspection Pitch\nBreak into groups\nRead through Post Inspection Pitch with Hail Damage a few times\nWHEN IN DOUBT, SIGN IT UP. Not every roof is going to look like it was destroyed by 2 inch hail.  But, we still find a lot of success here.\nInspection and Post-Inspection Quiz\nWhat are the first pictures you take when you are on the roof?\nYou should ask if they have the insurance company’s app or website login first – True or False?\nWe should be mainly focusing on Wind Only claims – Ture or False?\nWhat symbol do we use to mark hail damage?\nWhat symbol is used to mark wind damage?\nWhat are 2 methods you can use to see hail damage to metals better?\nYou should take all photos of hail damage first (so that they are grouped,) and then all photos of wind damage after – True or False?\nClaim Filing Information Sheet\nClaim Filing Information Sheet\nCalling the Insurance Company\nWe will each practice calling the Insurance Company to file the claim\nI will demonstrate a few examples\nConnect with your trainers on how to assist your clients with filing this claim\nPutting the script together\nGo through Initial Pitch without script\nGo straight to Inspection and Post-Inspection pitch while reading script\nRecap\nFamiliarize yourself with Storm Damage\nMemorize the order of the Inspection\nHave Initial Pitch (non-storm environment) and (Hail Only) Post-Inspection Pitch memorized\nFamiliarize yourself with Claim Filing Information Sheet\nAlways ask Homeowner if they have the website login or app to file the claim first\nPlease be in and ready to start tomorrow morning at 1000am\nRoof-ER Sales Training\nWelcome:\nShilongo Shilongo\nVladimir Mosendz\nGiancarlo Moran\nBenjamin Salgado\nInitial Pitch and Post-Inspection Pitch\nBreak into groups\nReview memorized scripts (Initial Pitch and Post Inspection Pitch)\nSales App (Only on your iPad)\nContingency and Claim Authorization\nGoogle Drive\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\nThis is where you really go for the close\nAfter filing the claim: “Okay, perfect! Like they said, an adjuster will be reaching out to you in the next 24 to 48 hours to schedule the inspection. The absolute most important part of this process is that I am at this inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. They are trying to mitigate their losses after storms. I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake.”\nTurn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see.\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\n“This basic/simple agreement backs you as the homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost will be your deductible if we get you fully approved. If it is a partial approval or denial, first we will fight and jump through the necessary hoops to turn that into a full approval; but if we are not able to get you fully approved, this contract is null and void and you do not owe us a penny.\n“What’s in it for us, is we just want to get to do the work. This agreement commits you to using us if we hold up our end of the bargain and achieve a full-approval.”\nYou sign\nThey sign\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\n“This next form is our Claim Authorization form.

If you do,  I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nPause here – Wait for them to respond/agree.\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.\nGo in for a handshake. “What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am (your name).  Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great!

This payment is called Actual Cash Value (ACV)\nYou receive $1,000 of the job at Downpayment.\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bInstall and Final Payment\nThe install will typically be scheduled in 4 – 6 weeks from the time that the Homeowner submits Downpayment\nAfter the install is complete, we will schedule a Quality Check and Wrap Up with the homeowner. \nThey will sign the Certificate of Completion here and we will submit this to the insurance company\nThe insurance company will then release the remaining funds.  They call this payment Depreciation.\nThe Homeowner then submits Final Payment.  This payment is a combination of the Depreciation plus their insurance deductible.\nOnce they submit Final Payment, you will receive the remaining 16% of the job.\nThe first 6 weeks, you get 16% of all completed jobs.

How thorough of an inspection you  should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is most important. It doesn’t  matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you don’t have enough damage-photos for  the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim. \nFlashlight\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nKnock on the door \n“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. First I walked around the perimeter of the house  to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the roof.” Say this while going through house number and overview photos \nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story.  Think of us like lawyers and this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof approved.”\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage\nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is circular  in nature.   Even if this  damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these hail divots fill with water, freeze….,  when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance company is responsible and your policy covers this type of damage.” \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. \n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nNow show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts\n“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be what’s protecting your home.
