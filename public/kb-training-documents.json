Non-Storm Damage\nWelcome to Roof-ER!\nMeet the Owner:\nMy name is Oliver Brown. I founded this company in 2019, not because I have a passion for roofing or because I was born into a family of contractors, but because I saw an opportunity. An opportunity to change the reputation of roofing companies and contractors as a whole. This is an industry that is known for lack of communication, poor workmanship, used car sales techniques and straight up deceit by companies who still write up quotes with a pen and paper. With a little bit of modern thinking, integrity and hard work we’ve been able to build a strong brand and reputation in a relatively short amount of time. From $2.5m in year one, as a one man sales team to $20m in 2023, we are one of the fastest growing roofing companies in the DMV. That growth has only been possible by attracting like minded people who are looking to change their lives and those around them… And we are just getting started! \nWe have ambitions of growing up and down the east coast and eventually becoming a national brand. To accomplish this we need to continue to add and develop hungry, competitive team members who are dedicated to the big picture but disciplined to execute on a day to day basis. \nWelcome to your new career!\nMy name is Reese Samala, Director of Sales, here at Roof-ER! I will be spending your first week here with you.  I am excited to see what you accomplish here with us.\nA quick introduction of who I am:\nI am a medically retired Infantryman in the Army.  I have held previous positions as an automotive technician, various sales roles, and also had my own government contracting business.\nI am excited about the opportunities we are creating here.  We are dynamically\nI am a medically retired Infantryman in the Army.

You will hear me say this many times throughout your time here with us: My marker of success is being able to see other people achieve things that they have not been able to achieve previously. \nThank you and I am excited to see what you accomplish here!\nReese Samala\nMission and Values\nOur Mission:\nAt Roof-ER, our mission is to hold a fiduciary responsibility to our customers - plain and simple.

I have seen the success that others achieved by committing to this process - I WILL be part of that.\nInitial Pitch\n5 Non-negotiables with every pitch\nWho you are\nWho we are and what we do (Roof ER)\nMake it relatable\nWhat you’re there to do (an inspection)\nGo for the close (them agreeing to the inspection)\nKnock on door/ring doorbell \nAs they are opening the door, smile and wave. \n“Hi, how are you? My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that specializes in helping homeowners get their roof and/or siding replaced, paid for by their insurance!”  \nGeneric\n“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Maryland over the past few months that have done a lot of damage! \n“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof (and/or siding) replaced.”\nOR\nSpecific\n“Were you home for the storm we had in ___. Wait for answer\nIf yes “It was pretty crazy right?! Wait for answer \nIf no: “Oh no worries at all, we get that all the time.\nIf yes move on to next line\n“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof (and/or siding) replaced.”\n“While\ntime.\nIf yes move on to next line\n“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof (and/or siding) replaced.”\n“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do,  I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.\nGo in for a handshake. What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am (your name).  Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“I will give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection. (See Inspection and Post-Inspection Script for detailed next steps.)\nInspection - Ideal photo progression \n§Mailbox/House Number/§Overview of House\n§Front Elevation Collateral\n§Damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, siding\n§Right Elevation  Collateral\n§Damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, siding\n§Rear Elevation Collateral\n§Damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, siding\n§Left Elevation Collateral\n§Damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, siding\n§Roof Overview Collateral\n§Damage to roof metals and other collateral on the roof\n§Circle Hail Hits & Slash Wind Damage (close up of each)\n§Overview of majority of the damage chalked up\n§Pictures of granules in the gutters or at the bottom of downspouts \n§Entire inspection shouldn’t take any longer than 15-20 minutes. How thorough of an inspection you  should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is most important. It doesn’t\nbottom of downspouts \n§Entire inspection shouldn’t take any longer than 15-20 minutes. How thorough of an inspection you  should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is most important. It doesn’t  matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you don’t have enough damage-photos for  the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim.\n§Flashlight\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nKnock on the door \n“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. First I walked around the perimeter of the house  to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the roof.”  \nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story.  Think of us like lawyers and this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof and/or siding approved.”\n\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage (IF there were any wind damaged shingles or missing shingles say:) and  anything I have slashed means its wind damage. \nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is circular  in nature.   Even if this  damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these hail divots fill with water, freeze….,  when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance company is responsible and your policy covers this type of damage.” \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. \n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.  \nIf there was wind damage or missing shingles, say the following:\n\n“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have both shingles that are creased from the wind lifting them up and shingles that have completely been blown off.”\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles (if applicable)\n“This is very similar to damage to ________ home and/or the rest of the approvals we\nased from the wind lifting them up and shingles that have completely been blown off.”\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles (if applicable)\n“This is very similar to damage to ________ home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the area”.  \n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when your insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all the damage that I  just showed you.” \n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go get iPad \nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10  Minutes”?\nOnce you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled. \n“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system. Then we can give your  insurance company a call”. \nGather information from the homeowner:\nFull name\nAddress\nPhone Number  \nE-mail\nInsurance Company\n“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”! \nAfter you have collected all the information:\nAsk if they have the app or if they have the login to the website. \nIf not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO.  As you are writing or typing the information for the HO to use on the call, explain each part to them.\nAs much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call \nReference Claim Filing Information Sheet\nMove on to Contingency & Claim Authorization\nClaim Filing Information Sheet  \nYou should use this information to prep the HO – Use a blank note on your iPad\nHO: “I’d like to file a claim for hail [and wind] damage” (never only wind)\nInsurance: “What was damaged?”\nRoof\nDownspouts\nGutters\nWindow Wraps\nSiding\nEtc.\nDate of loss\nTime of storm (usually around 5pm)\nSize of hail (usually 1 – 1.5 inches)\nType of shingle and/or siding\nAny\nGutters\nWindow Wraps\nSiding\nEtc.\nDate of loss\nTime of storm (usually around 5pm)\nSize of hail (usually 1 – 1.5 inches)\nType of shingle and/or siding\nAny interior damage?\nIs the house livable?\nWas there any personal property damaged?\nDid they lose power?\nHave you selected a contractor? (yes, we want them to know ASAP that you are working with me)\nDo they have an estimate? (always no)\nIs your roof steeper than an average staircase?\nHow high is the roof/is it difficult to access with most ladders?\nThings they should do on the call:\nAsk for adjuster info, if not available yet, that’s okay too.\nAlways ask for claim number\nIf Claim Rep wants to schedule the inspection now (only Allstate) – have 3 available times listed out for the HO\nSee example on next page\nExample Claim Filing Information Sheet\nLet them know you would like to file a claim for hail and wind damage.\nWhat was damaged: Roof and Aluminum siding\nDate of the storm: September 8th 2023\nTime of the storm: Around 5pm\nSize of hail: 1 inch\nType of shingle: Asphalt\nType of siding: Aluminum\nInterior Damage: Yes, 1 bedroom upstairs\nIs the house livable: Yes\nWas there any personal property damaged: No\nDid they lose power: No\nHave you selected a contractor: Yes, Roof ER out of Vienna VA. All my information is on the business card\nDid they give you an estimate: No\nIs your roof steeper than a staircase: No\nHow high is your roof/is it difficult to access with most ladders: No, it has 1 story access\nAfter they say the claim is filed, please ask for the Claim Number\nAfter they provide that, ask if an adjuster has been assigned\nContingency & Claim Authorization\nAfter the call: “Okay, perfect! (Like they said,) an adjuster will be reaching out to you in the next 24 to 48 hours to schedule the inspection. The absolute most important part of this process is that I am at this inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. They are trying to mitigate their losses after storms. I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake. \nTurn the iPad so you and the homeowner\nthat I am at this inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. They are trying to mitigate their losses after storms. I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake. \nTurn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see. \n“This basic/simple agreement backs you as the homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost will be your deductible if we get you fully approved. If it is a partial approval or denial, first we will fight and jump through the necessary hoops to turn that into a full approval; but if we are not able to get you fully approved, this contract is null and void and you do not owe us a penny.”\n“What’s in it for us, is we just want to get to do the work. This agreement commits you to using us if we hold up our end of the bargain and achieve a full-approval.”\nYou sign\nThey sign\n“This next form is our Claim Authorization form.  Very simple, it allows us to communicate with your insurance company.  I’ll be here for the inspection and  we will also communicate with them through email and phone calls so you don’t have to be a middle-man.  Of course, I’ll always keep you looped in with our communication by CCing you in all emails and updating you on any conversations we have.\nThey sign\nPress Submit enter password “roofer” if it asks.\n“Alright, we are all set! Again, the most important part of this process is that I am here when the insurance company comes out.  Ideally you can have them call me to schedule that directly. If they call me, great! But, regardless, please get the adjuster’s information (name, email, phone number) and send that over to me so that I can communicate with them before the inspection. If they insist on scheduling with you, go ahead and pencil in a time and avoid these times and days [provide your schedule]\nAnswer any questions that the HO may have\n“Thank you, sir/ma’am, looking forward to seeing you on the day of inspection, you have my contact information on my card if you need anything else\nShingle Types\n3-Tab: \nArchitectural: \nDiscontinued Shingles\n Horizon\n Tiger Stripe\nIndependence\nDamage Photos\nStorm Damage: \nNot Storm Damage:\nural: \nDiscontinued Shingles\n Horizon\n Tiger Stripe\nIndependence\nDamage Photos\nStorm Damage: \nNot Storm Damage:",

I am assisting [CUSTOMER NAME].\nAttached are:\nOur photo report documenting additional siding damage,\n\nAn iTel report confirming the siding is discontinued,\n\nReference to building code R703, which requires full siding replacement for compliance.\n\nBecause the siding is discontinued and repairs would cause consequential damage, patch repair is not a cost-effective or code-compliant solution. The only way to restore [CUSTOMER NAME]’s property is full siding replacement on all elevations.\nPlease review these findings and provide a revised estimate accordingly. If additional inspection is required, I will gladly meet your adjuster on-site.\nThank you for your time and cooperation in restoring [CUSTOMER NAME]’s home.\n[Signature & Contact Info]\n4️⃣ Escalation if Denied Again\nHave homeowner send the “Customer to Insurance” template .\n\nIf still stuck, file complaint with Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) citing Bulletin 18-23 on mismatch claims .\n\nLast resort: consider arbitration .\n\n✅ End Result: You’ve hit them with\nPhoto evidence,\n\nManufacturer & iTel data,\n\nCode citations,\n\nHomeowner involvement,\n\nState insurance rules.\n\nThat’s the 5-layer defense that usually forces a scope revision.\n clear picture of your Roof-ER job stages, based on the training deck you uploaded .\nHere’s how they flow:\n🔹 \nJob Stages & Timeline\nLead Generation / Door Knocking\n\nGoal: 70 doors/day\n\nUse pitch script (storm vs non-storm)\n\nPin houses in Field Portal\n\nInspection\n\nWalk perimeter → note collateral damage (gutters, siding, downspouts, screens, etc.)\n\nGet roof overview + chalk wind/hail hits\n\nTake full photo set (portrait orientation for reports)\n\nSafety: Cougar Paws, pitch hopper, bungees, etc.\n\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n\nShow photos of collateral first → build the “case”\n\nThen show roof damage photos (hail = circles, wind = slashes)\n\nExplain long-term damage (granule loss, leaks, deterioration)\n\nPrep homeowner for claim filing\n\nClaim Filing & Authorization\n\nFile claim with HO (use HO’s phone\nshow roof damage photos (hail = circles, wind = slashes)\n\nExplain long-term damage (granule loss, leaks, deterioration)\n\nPrep homeowner for claim filing\n\nClaim Filing & Authorization\n\nFile claim with HO (use HO’s phone/app when possible)\n\nHave HO sign Contingency Agreement (Roof-ER gets the job if fully approved)\n\nHave HO sign Claim Authorization Form (allows you to communicate with insurance)\n\nAdjuster Meeting (AM)\n\nHappens 2–7 days after claim filed\n\nRep meets insurance adjuster on-site\n\nShow collateral + roof damage, ensure adjuster sees everything\n\nDOs: Show up early, chalk metals, build rapport, tactfully present case\n\nDON’Ts: Be confrontational, take over inspection, or miss the meeting\n\nInsurance Decision\n\nUsually 1–10 business days after AM\n\nOften partial or denial first time around\n\nRep must use templates (Photo Report, Repair Attempt, iTel, etc.) to push back\n\nProject Meeting\n\nOnce full approval obtained → send estimate to Amber (estimates@theroofdocs.com)\n\nJob assigned to Project Coordinator\n\nPC meets with HO, signs Project Docs, and collects Downpayment (ACV check)\n\n\nInstall Scheduling\n\nUsually 4–6 weeks after Downpayment\n\nCoordinated via Trade Calendar\n\nInstall & Wrap Up\n\nRoof installed\n\nQuality Check + Wrap Up with HO\n\nHO signs Certificate of Completion\n\nCertificate sent to insurance → triggers depreciation release\n\nFinal Payment\n\nHO pays deductible + depreciation funds\n\nRep receives remaining commission % (based on signups/volume)\n\nclear Job Stage Guide for Roof-ER.\nThis will tell you where jobs SHOULD be, and where they SHOULD NOT be at each point.\n🗂 Roof-ER Job Stages Guide\n1. \nLead / Knock\n✅ Job should be here when:\nYou’ve pinned a house in Field Portal\n\nNo inspection yet\n\n🚫 Job should NOT be moved forward until:\nHomeowner agrees to inspection\n\n2. \nInspection\n✅ Job should be here when:\nYou’ve completed the free inspection\n\nPhotos taken + damages chalked\n\nReady for post-inspection pitch\n\n🚫 Do NOT move to Claim until:\nHO agrees to file a claim\n\nContingency & Claim Authorization signed\n\n3. \nClaim Filed\n✅ Job should be here when:\nClaim filed with insurance (ideally on HO’s phone)\n\nClaim #

How thorough of an\ninspection you should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is\nmost important. It doesn’t matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you\ndon’t have enough damage-photos for the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim.\n▪ Flashlight\n▪ Knock on the door\n▪ “Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you.\nFirst I walked around the perimeter of the house to look\nfor collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral\ndamage we found on the roof.” Say this while going\nthrough house number and overview photos\n▪ Start showing the pictures of damage to screens,\nPost-Inspection\ngutters, downspouts, and soft metals\nPitch\n▪ “While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really\nhelps build a story. Think of us like lawyers and this\ncollateral damage is the evidence that builds the case\nwhich helps us get the roof approved.”\n▪ Continue to slide through collateral damage photos\n▪ “Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles.\nAnything I have circled means its hail damage\n▪ Remain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the\nfollowing\n▪ “This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail\ndamage. If you notice, the divot is circular in nature. Even if\nthis damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over\nPost-Inspection\ntime, these hail divots fill with water, freeze…., when water\nfreezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will\nPitch\neventually lead to leaks. That is why your insurance\ncompany is responsible and your policy covers this type of\ndamage.”\n▪ Start slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\n▪ “As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.\n▪ Start slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\n▪ Now show them pictures of the granules in gutters and\ndownspouts\n▪ “As you can see here, granules have filled up your\ngutters. These granules are supposed to be what’s\nprotecting your home. When wind and hail hits your\nPost-Inspection\nroof, it knocks out these granules which reduces the\nlifespan of your roof.”\nPitch\n▪ Put phone away\n▪ “This is very similar to damage to ________’s home\nand/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the\narea”.\n▪ “With that being said, insurance companies are always\nlooking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate\nbut that’s how they make money. The most important\npart of this process is that when your insurance\ncompany comes out to run their inspection, we are here\nas storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get\na fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure\nPost-Inspection\nthey see all the damage that I just showed you.”\nPitch ▪ “What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my\niPad and we can get this process started”! Go get iPad\n▪ As you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is\nthere a place we could sit down for 5-10 Minutes”?\n▪ Once you are in the house, spend some time building\nrapport as you get settled.\n▪ “Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our\nsystem. Then we can let your insurance company know about the\ndamage”.\n▪ Gather information from the homeowner:\n▪ Full name\n▪ Address\n▪ Phone Number\n▪ E-mail\n▪ Insurance Company\nPost-Inspection\n▪ “Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”!\n▪ After you have collected all the information:\nPitch\n▪ Ask if they have the app or if they have the login to the website.\n▪ If not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO. As you are\nwriting or typing the information for the HO to use on the call, explain\neach part to them.\n▪ As much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call\n▪ Reference Claim Filing Information Sheet\n▪ Move on to Contingency & Claim Authorization\n▪ “Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles.\nAnything I have circled means its hail damage and\nanything I have slashed means its wind damage.”\n▪ After you go through the lines explaining the hail\nPost-Inspection\ndamage, say:\nPitch:\n▪ “Now here are the wind damaged shingles.

    "content": "Documentation & Templates (Q101–Q125)\nQ101: Question: \nWhen should the Repair Attempt Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when a repair was attempted and shingles cracked, tore, or failed — proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Repair Attempt Template should be used anytime a repair test is performed and the shingles crack, tear, or break when manipulated. This template documents the attempt and outcome, proving to insurance that repairs are not feasible. It provides a professional, standardized way to present irreparability .\nQ102: Adjuster says: \n“Repair attempt wasn’t necessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard to determine reparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair attempts are an industry-accepted method to test whether shingles are repairable. Our documented attempt caused additional damage, confirming brittleness and irreparability. This supports the need for full replacement .\nQ103: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did you damage my roof during testing?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is standard and proves shingles can’t be repaired .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe brittle test may look like damage, but it’s an industry-accepted method to confirm whether shingles are repairable. By carefully attempting to lift and reseal shingles, we document whether they fracture. If they do, as in this case, it proves irreparability and strengthens your claim for full replacement .\nQ104: Carrier says: \n“Your repair attempt caused the damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage during repair attempt proves brittleness, not contractor error .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our repair attempt caused the damage. In reality, the cracking during the attempt is the proof of brittleness and irreparability. The Repair Attempt Template documents this result. Repairs would cause more harm, confirming the need for replacement .\nQ105: Question: \nWhen should the Generic Partial Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when insurance approves only part of a roof/siding but evidence supports more .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\n.\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\nQ106: Adjuster says: \n“We only approved the slope with visible damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur inspection found collateral damage across multiple slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved one slope only. Our inspection and photo report show consistent collateral damage across multiple slopes. Storm impact is not limited to a single slope. The Generic Partial Template language applies to request revision .\nQ107: Carrier says: \n“We left gutters out — no evidence of damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows gutter dents and granule wash consistent with storm .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou omitted gutters. Our photo report shows storm-related dents and granule washout in gutters. These are valid storm impacts that must be included. The Generic Partial Template can be used to request full scope .\nQ108: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover siding on one wall only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland matching requirement prohibits mismatched siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour approval of one siding wall ignores matching requirements. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless excluded by policy. The Generic Partial Template applies to request full replacement .\nQ109: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do we need the Generic Partial Template?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt challenges partial approvals by showing all affected areas .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is needed when the insurance company tries to pay for only part of the damage. It uses standardized language to point out that storm damage affected more than just one slope or wall. It helps push for full approval .\nQ110: Question: \nWhen should the Photo Report Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse whenever submitting photographic proof of damage to insurance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Photo Report Template should be used whenever you compile photographic evidence of storm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nstorm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report documents creases, mat exposure, and missing shingles .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our photos. The Photo Report Template clearly documents creased shingles, exposed mats, and missing tabs. These conditions are functional damage, not cosmetic, and require replacement .\nQ112: Carrier says: \n“Collateral damage isn’t covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) helps prove storm event .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded collateral. Our photo report documents dents in gutters and metals. These items confirm storm event impact and must be considered when determining full scope .\nQ113: Homeowner asks: \n“Why are photos important if the adjuster already inspected?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhotos create a permanent record and highlight missed damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nPhotos are essential because they provide a permanent, timestamped record of storm damage. Even if an adjuster inspected, photos highlight missed or overlooked issues. The Photo Report Template ensures this evidence is presented clearly .\nQ114: Adjuster says: \n“Your photos don’t show hail size.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage, not hail size, determines coverage — shown in report .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our photos due to hail size. Insurance coverage is based on damage, not size. Our photo report documents functional impacts: bruises, granule loss, and fractures. These require replacement regardless of stone size .\nQ115: Carrier says: \n“Photos aren’t professional evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto reports are industry standard for claim documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated photos aren’t valid evidence. In fact, photo reports are an industry standard and form part of nearly every claim review. They are recognized as valid proof of storm damage .\nQ116: Question: \nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier\nQuestion: \nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier delays, denies, or refuses fair inspection. Insurance companies respond more seriously when the request comes directly from their policyholder. This template ensures the homeowner speaks in the right language .\nQ117: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do I need to send the letter instead of Roof-ER?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInsurance responds more when it comes from the policyholder .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nInsurance companies must respond directly to their customers. When Roof-ER sends a letter, it may not carry the same weight. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures the homeowner applies pressure themselves, often getting faster results .\nQ118: Carrier says: \n“We already explained our decision.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCustomer letter reinforces their rights and requests reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nThe policyholder has the right to challenge your decision. Using the Customer-to-Insurance Template, they’ve reiterated their request for fair handling and restoration to pre-loss condition. A customer’s direct appeal requires serious consideration .\nQ119: Homeowner asks: \n“What if I don’t feel comfortable pushing insurance?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe provide the template — they just copy/paste it .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe homeowner doesn’t need to “fight” with insurance. They simply copy/paste the provided Customer-to-Insurance Template into an email and send it. Roof-ER provides the wording; the customer’s role is only to hit send .\nQ120: Adjuster says: \n“Customer letters don’t change anything.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarrier must respond when request comes from policyholder .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said customer letters don’t matter. However, you are required to respond directly to the policyholder. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures their request is framed clearly. This obligates a reconsideration under fair claims handling .\nQ121: Question: \nWhen should the Siding Argument Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mism\niding Argument Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mismatches, or because removal of housewrap causes consequential damage. It standardizes the language for challenging siding denials .\nQ122: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace one siding panel.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPanel removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed panel replacement. Per our siding argument documentation, removing one panel requires detaching adjoining ones and often the corner post. This causes consequential damage and makes panel-only replacement infeasible .\nQ123: Carrier says: \n“We found a close match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirmed no reasonable match exists; close isn’t acceptable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated a close siding match exists. The iTel report confirms no reasonable match is available. Color and profile mismatches reduce property value and fail to restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\nQ124: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just paint or blend siding?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPainting/mixing voids warranty and doesn’t restore pre-loss condition .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nPainting or blending siding may seem like a solution, but it voids manufacturer warranty and doesn’t restore the home to its pre-loss condition. The Siding Argument Template explains why only full replacement is acceptable .\nQ125: Adjuster says: \n“Housewrap isn’t necessary for siding repair.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMD Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier behind siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied housewrap during siding repair. Per Maryland Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting WRB violates code and risks moisture intrusion. This must be included .\nQ126: Carrier says: \n“We can repair aluminum siding dents.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nAluminum siding dents are permanent; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be\nents are permanent; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be replaced to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ127: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace a few vinyl panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVinyl becomes brittle with age; panel removal causes cracking .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only a few vinyl siding panels. Per our siding argument, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks when removed, making panel-only replacement impossible. Full wall replacement is required .\nQ128: Carrier says: \n“We’ll blend new siding with old.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBlending creates mismatched color/profile; iTel confirms no match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed blending new with old siding. The iTel report confirms no suitable match is available. Mixing profiles and colors creates mismatches and does not restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\nQ129: Homeowner asks: \n“What if siding mismatch doesn’t bother me?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInsurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nEven if mismatches don’t bother the homeowner, insurance is obligated to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. Per our siding argument, mismatched siding reduces value and fails to meet claim requirements .\nQ130: Carrier says: \n“We’ll paint siding to match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPainting voids warranty and fades differently than factory siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested painting new siding to match. Per our siding argument, painting siding voids manufacturer warranty and fades unevenly compared to factory finish. This is not a valid repair. Replacement is required .\nQ131: Question: \nWhen should the Estimate Request Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when insurance estimate omits items or underpays scope .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Estimate Request Template is used whenever the insurance estimate is incomplete — missing items like flashing, underlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .\nQ132: Adjuster says: \n“Our estimate is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence requires revision — outlined in\nunderlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .\nQ132: Adjuster says: \n“Our estimate is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence requires revision — outlined in Estimate Request Template .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said the estimate is final. The Estimate Request Template provides standardized language to show new documentation (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires revision of your estimate. We respectfully request corrections .\nQ133: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for code compliance.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template cites VA/MD code upgrades .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied code items. The Estimate Request Template language cites specific state codes, such as Maryland Code R703 (WRB) and VA Code 908.5 (flashing). These are not optional — they are code requirements that must be included .\nQ134: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is your estimate higher than insurance’s?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe include all code-required and manufacturer-required items .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nOur estimate may be higher because it includes all code-required upgrades and manufacturer-required components that insurance sometimes leaves out. The Estimate Request Template is how we push back to ensure these are included .\nQ135: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t pay for underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires new underlayment; reusing voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF installation standards, new underlayment must be installed when reroofing. Reusing underlayment voids warranty. The Estimate Request Template language requests this correction .\nQ136: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFlashing replacement required by VA Code 908.5 .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, all damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced when reroofing. This is a code requirement, not optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n“We priced shingles too low.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom\nnot optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n“We priced shingles too low.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nThe shingle pricing in your estimate is below current market value. The Estimate Request Template provides language to request market-appropriate pricing corrections. This ensures the claim reflects actual replacement costs .\nQ138: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did insurance’s estimate leave items out?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarriers often omit code/manufacturer items — we use Estimate Request Template to fix .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nInsurance estimates frequently omit items like drip edge, flashing, or WRB. These omissions reduce the payout. We use the Estimate Request Template to point out and correct these errors so the homeowner receives full coverage .\nQ139: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for WRB.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded WRB. Per Maryland Code R703, siding must include a water-resistive barrier. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement and requests correction .\nQ140: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for ridge vent.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vents must be removed for slope replacement; new required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing slopes and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template requests this correction .\nQ141: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for drip edge.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIRC requires drip edge at eaves and rakes .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded drip edge. Per the IRC adopted in Virginia, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement for correction .\nQ142: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to send estimate corrections?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCorrections ensure code compliance and fair market value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe send estimate corrections to ensure all code-required items and market-appropriate pricing are included. Without corrections, homeowners are left with underfunded claims. The Estimate Request Template makes these corrections formal .\nQ\nfair market value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe send estimate corrections to ensure all code-required items and market-appropriate pricing are included. Without corrections, homeowners are left with underfunded claims. The Estimate Request Template makes these corrections formal .\nQ143: Adjuster says: \n“Your corrections aren’t valid.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCorrections are backed by manufacturer guidelines and state code .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve rejected our corrections. The Estimate Request Template is based on manufacturer requirements and building code citations. These are not optional suggestions; they are mandatory. Corrections must be made .\nQ144: Carrier says: \n“Your estimate inflates costs.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur estimate includes only code and manufacturer-required items .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our estimate inflates costs. In reality, our estimate includes only what is required by building code and manufacturer standards. The Estimate Request Template ensures we justify these inclusions .\nQ145: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover valley flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code 908.5 requires flashing replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded valley flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during reroofing. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement .\nQ146: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for chimney flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIRC requires flashing at all penetrations .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded chimney flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing is required at all penetrations, including chimneys. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\nQ147: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t pay for skylight flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSkylight flashing must be replaced when roof is replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations. Skylight flashing cannot be reused and must be replaced. The Estimate Request Template addresses this correction .\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it\n.\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it eliminates subjectivity. Carriers cannot deny items required by law. The Estimate Request Template ensures each correction is supported by code .\nQ149: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires starter strips at eaves/rakes for wind warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind warranty. The Estimate Request Template ensures these are included .\nQ150: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover ridge caps.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge caps must be replaced when slopes are replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\nQ151: Question: \nWhen should the iTel Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when shingles/siding are discontinued and repairs would cause mismatches .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe iTel Template is used whenever a carrier suggests patching, but iTel testing confirms the shingles or siding are discontinued. By citing iTel’s lab analysis and the Discontinued Shingle List, it proves no suitable replacement exists and full replacement is required .\nQ152: Adjuster says: \n“We found similar shingles available.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirmed no match exists; mixing voids manufacturer warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested similar shingles are available. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued with no acceptable match. Installing mismatched shingles violates manufacturer warranty and reduces property value. Full replacement is required .\nQ153: Carrier says: \n“Metric shingles can replace English dimension.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMetric and English shingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent\nshingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent proper sealant alignment. This misalignment voids warranty and fails to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ154: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just mix old and new shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant alignment .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nMixing discontinued shingles with new ones creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant placement. These differences compromise wind resistance and void manufacturer warranty. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms no compatible products are available .\nQ155: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll only replace damaged shingles, not full slope.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirms discontinued; partial replacement isn’t possible .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed replacing only visibly damaged shingles. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued. Since replacements cannot match, partial repairs would be defective. Full slope replacement is the only solution .\nQ156: Carrier says: \n“We can still patch siding with a close match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nClose match isn’t acceptable; iTel confirms discontinued siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested patching siding with a close match. The iTel analysis confirms the siding is discontinued and no match exists. Mismatched siding reduces property value and violates Maryland matching regulations .\nQ157: Homeowner asks: \n“What is an iTel report?”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel is a lab test confirming material type and availability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAn iTel report is a laboratory analysis of a material sample (shingle, siding, etc.). It confirms product type, manufacturer, and whether it is still available. If discontinued, it provides written proof repairs are not feasible .\nQ158: Carrier says: \n“We don’t accept iTel reports.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel is independent lab analysis widely accepted in the industry .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and\nwidely accepted in the industry .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and provide objective proof of discontinuation .\nQ159: Adjuster says: \n“Shingles look available at Home Depot.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRetail stores don’t confirm compatibility; iTel confirms discontinuation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated similar shingles appear in retail stores. Availability at retail does not guarantee dimensional compatibility. The iTel report confirms the original shingles are discontinued and no suitable match exists .\nQ160: Homeowner asks: \n“Why does discontinued matter if roof still works?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued means no repairs possible without mismatching .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf shingles are discontinued, no replacements match in size, color, or sealant alignment. This makes repairs impossible without mismatching. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms when a roof system can no longer be patched, requiring full replacement .\nQ161: Carrier says: \n“We’ll approve repair, not replacement, despite iTel.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel proves repairs impossible; replacement is required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved repair despite iTel findings. The iTel report proves the product is discontinued, making repairs impossible without mismatches. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ162: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll blend different shingle lots.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLot variations cause color mismatch; iTel confirms no true match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested blending different lots of shingles. Lot variations cause visible color mismatches, and per the iTel report, the original shingles are discontinued. No blending can restore uniformity. Full replacement is required .\nQ163: Carrier says: \n“Discontinued list isn’t proof.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued list + iTel lab analysis confirm unavailability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t\n’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just re-use old shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOld shingles crack when lifted; repair attempt shows brittleness .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nReusing old shingles isn’t possible because once lifted, they crack or fail to reseal. Our repair attempt video documents brittleness. Combined with discontinued status, reuse is not feasible .\nQ165: Adjuster says: \n“New manufacturer products are close enough.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing brands violates warranty and reduces property value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed using a different manufacturer’s product. Mixing brands voids warranty and creates mismatches in size and color. The iTel report confirms no acceptable alternative exists .\nQ166: Carrier says: \n“We’ll pay for only a few discontinued panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPartial payment ignores irreparability proven by iTel .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve offered to pay for a few discontinued panels. The iTel report proves no matches exist, so partial repairs aren’t feasible. Full replacement is required .\nQ167: Homeowner asks: \n“How does iTel help my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt provides third-party proof repairs aren’t possible .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAn iTel report is powerful because it’s a third-party lab test confirming discontinuation. Insurance companies must consider it credible evidence that repairs are not possible. It directly supports full replacement .\nQ168: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t need third-party verification.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel provides unbiased lab confirmation; not contractor opinion .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed iTel verification. Unlike contractor opinion, iTel is unbiased lab testing. It confirms material discontinuation in an objective, industry-accepted format .\nQ169: Carrier says: \n“We’ll allow repair with different dimensions.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric\nAnswer (with source):\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric sizes do not align, leaving sealant strips misaligned and vulnerable. Repairs are unsafe; full replacement is required .\nQ170: Homeowner asks: \n“Can insurance force me to accept mismatched materials?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — insurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nNo, insurance cannot force mismatched repairs. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding and roofing are not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in policy. You’re entitled to full replacement .\nQ171: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just caulk or seal damaged shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCaulking is not manufacturer-approved repair; voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed caulking damaged shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, caulking is not an approved repair method and voids warranty. Replacement is required .\nQ172: Carrier says: \n“We won’t accept discontinued list as evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued list + iTel confirm no replacement available .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. When paired with iTel lab testing, the Discontinued Shingle List confirms no suitable replacement is available. Together, they provide conclusive proof .\nQ173: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens if we can’t match?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode and regulations require full replacement when mismatching .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf a match isn’t possible, full replacement is required. Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 confirms that mismatched siding or roofing isn’t acceptable unless excluded in the policy .\nQ174: Adjuster says: \n“We can reuse discontinued shingles from repair stock.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStored shingles won’t align in color/age; still discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested using repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\nQ175: Carrier says:\nusing repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\nQ175: Carrier says: \n“We’ll patch siding with leftover stock.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLeftover siding won’t match aged/weathered walls; iTel confirms discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested using leftover siding stock. These pieces won’t match weathered siding on the home, and the iTel report confirms the line is discontinued. Patching with leftovers does not restore pre-loss condition .\nQ176: Question: \nWhen should the Arbitration Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier denies all appeals and homeowner seeks neutral review .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Arbitration Template should be used when all internal appeals with the insurance company have been exhausted and the carrier maintains denial. It initiates a neutral review process where an arbitrator evaluates the dispute. This forces the carrier to defend their denial against documented evidence .\nQ177: Carrier says: \n“Denial is final and not appealable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is a valid escalation option under policy rights .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the denial is final. Per the Arbitration Information template, the policyholder maintains the right to escalate unresolved disputes through arbitration. This process ensures fair claim handling beyond internal review .\nQ178: Homeowner asks: \n“What is arbitration?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is a neutral third-party review of the claim .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nArbitration is when a neutral third-party arbitrator reviews the evidence from both sides — homeowner and carrier — and makes a binding or advisory decision. It’s an escalation step if the carrier refuses to honor valid claim documentation .\nQ179: Carrier says: \n“Arbitration doesn’t apply here.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIf policy includes arbitration, carrier must participate .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration. If the policy includes arbitration provisions, the carrier must participate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and\nparticipate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and still binding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nArbitration avoids the delays and costs of lawsuits while still offering neutral review. It’s faster, more affordable, and often binding depending on policy terms. The Arbitration Template helps initiate this option effectively .\nQ181: Question: \nWhen should Complaint Forms be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier mishandles claim or refuses fair handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nComplaint Forms should be used when an insurance company delays, denies, or mishandles a claim unfairly. Filing with the state insurance administration creates oversight and pressures carriers to comply with fair claims practices .\nQ182: Carrier says: \n“State complaints won’t change our decision.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints trigger regulatory oversight carriers must respond to .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints won’t matter. Filing a state complaint forces regulatory oversight. Carriers must respond to the state authority, creating accountability in claim handling .\nQ183: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens after I file a complaint?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe state reviews carrier actions and demands formal response .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAfter you file a complaint, the state insurance administration reviews the carrier’s handling of your claim. The carrier must provide a formal written response. This often leads to claim reconsideration .\nQ184: Adjuster says: \n“Complaints are just paperwork.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints document mishandling and force carrier accountability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed complaints as meaningless. In fact, complaints document mishandling and force accountability under state oversight. Carriers must provide a formal justification, often leading to fairer outcomes .\nQ185: Homeowner asks: \n“Will filing a complaint hurt my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — it enforces fair handling and protects your rights .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\nQ186: Carrier says: \n“We don’t recognize\nTraining Draft):\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\nQ186: Carrier says: \n“We don’t recognize state complaints.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarriers are required by law to respond to complaints .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t recognize state complaints. By law, carriers must respond to oversight inquiries. Filing a Complaint Form compels this response and ensures review of claim handling .\nQ187: Question: \nWhen should both Arbitration and Complaint Forms be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier refuses reconsideration and claim is unresolved .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nBoth Arbitration and Complaint Forms should be used when a carrier refuses reconsideration despite documentation. Arbitration applies policy provisions for neutral review, while complaints trigger state oversight. Together, they maximize pressure for resolution .\nQ188: Homeowner asks: \n“Which should I do first: arbitration or complaint?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaint first for oversight; arbitration if still unresolved .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nGenerally, filing a complaint first is recommended because it creates regulatory oversight. If the carrier still refuses, then proceed to arbitration. Both paths are valid, but this order applies the most pressure .\nQ189: Carrier says: \n“We won’t change claim regardless of oversight.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOversight and arbitration hold carriers accountable by law .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated oversight won’t affect your decision. State regulators and arbitration provisions exist specifically to hold carriers accountable. Ignoring either is a violation of fair claim handling .\nQ190: Homeowner asks: \n“Do many people file complaints?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nYes — complaints are common and effective for unfair denials .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nYes, many homeowners file complaints when claims are unfairly denied or delayed. The Complaint Form process is standard and often leads to faster, fairer resolution .\nQ191: Carrier says: \n“We won’t respond to arbitration.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPolicy provisions require participation once initiated .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\nrequire participation once initiated .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\nQ192: Adjuster says: \n“Arbitration is just advisory.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMany arbitration decisions are binding per policy terms .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said arbitration is advisory only. Many policies make arbitration binding. Even when advisory, arbitrators’ decisions strongly influence resolution. The Arbitration Template enforces this right .\nQ193: Homeowner asks: \n“What if complaint doesn’t work?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nProceed to arbitration or escalate legally .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf a complaint doesn’t resolve the issue, the next step is arbitration or legal escalation. Complaints create oversight, but arbitration provides binding or advisory resolution if denial persists .\nQ194: Carrier says: \n“Customer has no further rights.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCustomer has right to complaint, arbitration, and legal action .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the customer has no further rights. In fact, policyholders maintain the right to complaints, arbitration, and legal remedies. Denying these rights is a violation of fair claims practices .\nQ195: Homeowner asks: \n“Is complaint filing complicated?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — forms are simple and Roof-ER provides guidance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFiling a complaint is straightforward. The forms are simple, and Roof-ER provides the homeowner with templates and step-by-step guidance. The Complaint Forms make the process efficient .\nQ196: Adjuster says: \n“Complaints waste time.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints are official state action carriers must respond to .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints waste time. In reality, complaints initiate state action that requires a carrier response. They are a valid escalation and often change claim outcomes .\nQ197: Carrier says: \n“Arbitration is too costly.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster and cheaper than litigation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration as costly. Arbitration is significantly faster and cheaper than litigation for both sides. It’s a valid escalation provided in\n):\nArbitration is faster and cheaper than litigation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration as costly. Arbitration is significantly faster and cheaper than litigation for both sides. It’s a valid escalation provided in many policies .\nQ198: Homeowner asks: \n“Will Roof-ER help with complaints/arbitration?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nYes — Roof-ER provides templates and guidance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nYes, Roof-ER supports homeowners through both complaints and arbitration. We provide templates, documentation, and coaching so customers can file confidently. The Arbitration and Complaint Forms are designed to make this process easy .\nQ199: Carrier says: \n“Complaints don’t prove storm damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints enforce fair handling, not damage proof .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints don’t prove damage. That is correct — complaints enforce fair handling of claims. Damage proof comes from repair attempts, iTel, and photo reports. Complaints ensure carriers treat this documentation fairly .\nQ200: Homeowner asks: \n“What’s the final step if all else fails?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLegal escalation is last resort after complaint/arbitration .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf both complaints and arbitration fail, the final step is legal escalation. Roof-ER can provide documentation and guidance, but attorneys handle this stage. Arbitration and complaints usually resolve issues before legal action is needed .\nDocumentation & Templates (Q101–Q125)\nQ101: Question: \nWhen should the Repair Attempt Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when a repair was attempted and shingles cracked, tore, or failed — proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Repair Attempt Template should be used anytime a repair test is performed and the shingles crack, tear, or break when manipulated. This template documents the attempt and outcome, proving to insurance that repairs are not feasible. It provides a professional, standardized way to present irreparability .\nQ102: Adjuster says: \n“Repair attempt wasn’t necessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard to determine reparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair attempts are an industry-accepted method to test whether shingles are repairable. Our documented attempt caused additional damage, confirming brittleness and irreparability. This supports the need for full replacement .\nQ103: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did you damage my roof during testing?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is standard and proves shingles can’t be repaired .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe brittle test may look like damage, but it’s an industry-accepted method to confirm whether shingles are repairable. By carefully attempting to lift and reseal shingles, we document whether they fracture. If they do, as in this case, it proves irreparability and strengthens your claim for full replacement .\nQ104: Carrier says: \n“Your repair attempt caused the damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage during repair attempt proves brittleness, not contractor error .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our repair attempt caused the damage. In reality, the cracking during the attempt is the proof of brittleness and irreparability. The Repair Attempt Template documents this result. Repairs would cause more harm, confirming the need for replacement .\nQ105: Question: \nWhen should the Generic Partial Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when insurance approves only part of a roof/siding but evidence supports more .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\n.\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\nQ106: Adjuster says: \n“We only approved the slope with visible damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur inspection found collateral damage across multiple slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved one slope only. Our inspection and photo report show consistent collateral damage across multiple slopes. Storm impact is not limited to a single slope. The Generic Partial Template language applies to request revision .\nQ107: Carrier says: \n“We left gutters out — no evidence of damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows gutter dents and granule wash consistent with storm .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou omitted gutters. Our photo report shows storm-related dents and granule washout in gutters. These are valid storm impacts that must be included. The Generic Partial Template can be used to request full scope .\nQ108: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover siding on one wall only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland matching requirement prohibits mismatched siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour approval of one siding wall ignores matching requirements. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless excluded by policy. The Generic Partial Template applies to request full replacement .\nQ109: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do we need the Generic Partial Template?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt challenges partial approvals by showing all affected areas .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Generic Partial Template is needed when the insurance company tries to pay for only part of the damage. It uses standardized language to point out that storm damage affected more than just one slope or wall. It helps push for full approval .\nQ110: Question: \nWhen should the Photo Report Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse whenever submitting photographic proof of damage to insurance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Photo Report Template should be used whenever you compile photographic evidence of storm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nstorm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report documents creases, mat exposure, and missing shingles .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our photos. The Photo Report Template clearly documents creased shingles, exposed mats, and missing tabs. These conditions are functional damage, not cosmetic, and require replacement .\nQ112: Carrier says: \n“Collateral damage isn’t covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) helps prove storm event .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded collateral. Our photo report documents dents in gutters and metals. These items confirm storm event impact and must be considered when determining full scope .\nQ113: Homeowner asks: \n“Why are photos important if the adjuster already inspected?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhotos create a permanent record and highlight missed damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nPhotos are essential because they provide a permanent, timestamped record of storm damage. Even if an adjuster inspected, photos highlight missed or overlooked issues. The Photo Report Template ensures this evidence is presented clearly .\nQ114: Adjuster says: \n“Your photos don’t show hail size.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage, not hail size, determines coverage — shown in report .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our photos due to hail size. Insurance coverage is based on damage, not size. Our photo report documents functional impacts: bruises, granule loss, and fractures. These require replacement regardless of stone size .\nQ115: Carrier says: \n“Photos aren’t professional evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto reports are industry standard for claim documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated photos aren’t valid evidence. In fact, photo reports are an industry standard and form part of nearly every claim review. They are recognized as valid proof of storm damage .\nQ116: Question: \nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier\nQuestion: \nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier delays, denies, or refuses fair inspection. Insurance companies respond more seriously when the request comes directly from their policyholder. This template ensures the homeowner speaks in the right language .\nQ117: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do I need to send the letter instead of Roof-ER?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInsurance responds more when it comes from the policyholder .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nInsurance companies must respond directly to their customers. When Roof-ER sends a letter, it may not carry the same weight. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures the homeowner applies pressure themselves, often getting faster results .\nQ118: Carrier says: \n“We already explained our decision.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCustomer letter reinforces their rights and requests reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nThe policyholder has the right to challenge your decision. Using the Customer-to-Insurance Template, they’ve reiterated their request for fair handling and restoration to pre-loss condition. A customer’s direct appeal requires serious consideration .\nQ119: Homeowner asks: \n“What if I don’t feel comfortable pushing insurance?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe provide the template — they just copy/paste it .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe homeowner doesn’t need to “fight” with insurance. They simply copy/paste the provided Customer-to-Insurance Template into an email and send it. Roof-ER provides the wording; the customer’s role is only to hit send .\nQ120: Adjuster says: \n“Customer letters don’t change anything.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarrier must respond when request comes from policyholder .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said customer letters don’t matter. However, you are required to respond directly to the policyholder. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures their request is framed clearly. This obligates a reconsideration under fair claims handling .\nQ121: Question: \nWhen should the Siding Argument Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mism\niding Argument Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mismatches, or because removal of housewrap causes consequential damage. It standardizes the language for challenging siding denials .\nQ122: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace one siding panel.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPanel removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing damage .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed panel replacement. Per our siding argument documentation, removing one panel requires detaching adjoining ones and often the corner post. This causes consequential damage and makes panel-only replacement infeasible .\nQ123: Carrier says: \n“We found a close match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirmed no reasonable match exists; close isn’t acceptable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated a close siding match exists. The iTel report confirms no reasonable match is available. Color and profile mismatches reduce property value and fail to restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\nQ124: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just paint or blend siding?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPainting/mixing voids warranty and doesn’t restore pre-loss condition .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nPainting or blending siding may seem like a solution, but it voids manufacturer warranty and doesn’t restore the home to its pre-loss condition. The Siding Argument Template explains why only full replacement is acceptable .\nQ125: Adjuster says: \n“Housewrap isn’t necessary for siding repair.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMD Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier behind siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied housewrap during siding repair. Per Maryland Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting WRB violates code and risks moisture intrusion. This must be included .\nQ126: Carrier says: \n“We can repair aluminum siding dents.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nAluminum siding dents are permanent; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be\nents are permanent; replacement required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be replaced to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ127: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace a few vinyl panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVinyl becomes brittle with age; panel removal causes cracking .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only a few vinyl siding panels. Per our siding argument, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks when removed, making panel-only replacement impossible. Full wall replacement is required .\nQ128: Carrier says: \n“We’ll blend new siding with old.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBlending creates mismatched color/profile; iTel confirms no match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed blending new with old siding. The iTel report confirms no suitable match is available. Mixing profiles and colors creates mismatches and does not restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\nQ129: Homeowner asks: \n“What if siding mismatch doesn’t bother me?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInsurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nEven if mismatches don’t bother the homeowner, insurance is obligated to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. Per our siding argument, mismatched siding reduces value and fails to meet claim requirements .\nQ130: Carrier says: \n“We’ll paint siding to match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPainting voids warranty and fades differently than factory siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested painting new siding to match. Per our siding argument, painting siding voids manufacturer warranty and fades unevenly compared to factory finish. This is not a valid repair. Replacement is required .\nQ131: Question: \nWhen should the Estimate Request Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when insurance estimate omits items or underpays scope .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Estimate Request Template is used whenever the insurance estimate is incomplete — missing items like flashing, underlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .\nQ132: Adjuster says: \n“Our estimate is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence requires revision — outlined in\nunderlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low.

The Estimate Request Template provides standardized language to show new documentation (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires revision of your estimate. We respectfully request corrections .\nQ133: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for code compliance.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template cites VA/MD code upgrades .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied code items. The Estimate Request Template language cites specific state codes, such as Maryland Code R703 (WRB) and VA Code 908.5 (flashing). These are not optional — they are code requirements that must be included .\nQ134: Homeowner asks: \n“Why is your estimate higher than insurance’s?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe include all code-required and manufacturer-required items .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nOur estimate may be higher because it includes all code-required upgrades and manufacturer-required components that insurance sometimes leaves out. The Estimate Request Template is how we push back to ensure these are included .\nQ135: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t pay for underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires new underlayment; reusing voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF installation standards, new underlayment must be installed when reroofing. Reusing underlayment voids warranty. The Estimate Request Template language requests this correction .\nQ136: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFlashing replacement required by VA Code 908.5 .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, all damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced when reroofing. This is a code requirement, not optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n“We priced shingles too low.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom\nnot optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n“We priced shingles too low.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nThe shingle pricing in your estimate is below current market value. The Estimate Request Template provides language to request market-appropriate pricing corrections. This ensures the claim reflects actual replacement costs .\nQ138: Homeowner asks: \n“Why did insurance’s estimate leave items out?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarriers often omit code/manufacturer items — we use Estimate Request Template to fix .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nInsurance estimates frequently omit items like drip edge, flashing, or WRB. These omissions reduce the payout. We use the Estimate Request Template to point out and correct these errors so the homeowner receives full coverage .\nQ139: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for WRB.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded WRB. Per Maryland Code R703, siding must include a water-resistive barrier. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement and requests correction .\nQ140: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for ridge vent.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vents must be removed for slope replacement; new required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing slopes and cannot be reused.

Per IRC R703.4, flashing is required at all penetrations, including chimneys. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\nQ147: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t pay for skylight flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSkylight flashing must be replaced when roof is replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations. Skylight flashing cannot be reused and must be replaced. The Estimate Request Template addresses this correction .\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it\n.\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it eliminates subjectivity. Carriers cannot deny items required by law. The Estimate Request Template ensures each correction is supported by code .\nQ149: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires starter strips at eaves/rakes for wind warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind warranty. The Estimate Request Template ensures these are included .\nQ150: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover ridge caps.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge caps must be replaced when slopes are replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\nQ151: Question: \nWhen should the iTel Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when shingles/siding are discontinued and repairs would cause mismatches .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe iTel Template is used whenever a carrier suggests patching, but iTel testing confirms the shingles or siding are discontinued. By citing iTel’s lab analysis and the Discontinued Shingle List, it proves no suitable replacement exists and full replacement is required .\nQ152: Adjuster says: \n“We found similar shingles available.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirmed no match exists; mixing voids manufacturer warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested similar shingles are available. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued with no acceptable match. Installing mismatched shingles violates manufacturer warranty and reduces property value. Full replacement is required .\nQ153: Carrier says: \n“Metric shingles can replace English dimension.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMetric and English shingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent\nshingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent proper sealant alignment. This misalignment voids warranty and fails to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ154: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just mix old and new shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant alignment .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nMixing discontinued shingles with new ones creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant placement. These differences compromise wind resistance and void manufacturer warranty. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms no compatible products are available .\nQ155: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll only replace damaged shingles, not full slope.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel confirms discontinued; partial replacement isn’t possible .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed replacing only visibly damaged shingles. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued. Since replacements cannot match, partial repairs would be defective. Full slope replacement is the only solution .\nQ156: Carrier says: \n“We can still patch siding with a close match.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nClose match isn’t acceptable; iTel confirms discontinued siding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested patching siding with a close match. The iTel analysis confirms the siding is discontinued and no match exists. Mismatched siding reduces property value and violates Maryland matching regulations .\nQ157: Homeowner asks: \n“What is an iTel report?”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel is a lab test confirming material type and availability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAn iTel report is a laboratory analysis of a material sample (shingle, siding, etc.). It confirms product type, manufacturer, and whether it is still available. If discontinued, it provides written proof repairs are not feasible .\nQ158: Carrier says: \n“We don’t accept iTel reports.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel is independent lab analysis widely accepted in the industry .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and\nwidely accepted in the industry .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and provide objective proof of discontinuation .\nQ159: Adjuster says: \n“Shingles look available at Home Depot.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRetail stores don’t confirm compatibility; iTel confirms discontinuation .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated similar shingles appear in retail stores. Availability at retail does not guarantee dimensional compatibility. The iTel report confirms the original shingles are discontinued and no suitable match exists .\nQ160: Homeowner asks: \n“Why does discontinued matter if roof still works?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued means no repairs possible without mismatching .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf shingles are discontinued, no replacements match in size, color, or sealant alignment. This makes repairs impossible without mismatching. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms when a roof system can no longer be patched, requiring full replacement .\nQ161: Carrier says: \n“We’ll approve repair, not replacement, despite iTel.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel proves repairs impossible; replacement is required .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved repair despite iTel findings. The iTel report proves the product is discontinued, making repairs impossible without mismatches. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ162: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll blend different shingle lots.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLot variations cause color mismatch; iTel confirms no true match .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested blending different lots of shingles. Lot variations cause visible color mismatches, and per the iTel report, the original shingles are discontinued. No blending can restore uniformity. Full replacement is required .\nQ163: Carrier says: \n“Discontinued list isn’t proof.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued list + iTel lab analysis confirm unavailability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t\n’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n“Why can’t you just re-use old shingles?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOld shingles crack when lifted; repair attempt shows brittleness .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nReusing old shingles isn’t possible because once lifted, they crack or fail to reseal. Our repair attempt video documents brittleness. Combined with discontinued status, reuse is not feasible .\nQ165: Adjuster says: \n“New manufacturer products are close enough.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing brands violates warranty and reduces property value .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed using a different manufacturer’s product. Mixing brands voids warranty and creates mismatches in size and color. The iTel report confirms no acceptable alternative exists .\nQ166: Carrier says: \n“We’ll pay for only a few discontinued panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPartial payment ignores irreparability proven by iTel .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve offered to pay for a few discontinued panels. The iTel report proves no matches exist, so partial repairs aren’t feasible. Full replacement is required .\nQ167: Homeowner asks: \n“How does iTel help my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIt provides third-party proof repairs aren’t possible .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAn iTel report is powerful because it’s a third-party lab test confirming discontinuation. Insurance companies must consider it credible evidence that repairs are not possible. It directly supports full replacement .\nQ168: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t need third-party verification.”\nShort Answer (with source):\niTel provides unbiased lab confirmation; not contractor opinion .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed iTel verification. Unlike contractor opinion, iTel is unbiased lab testing. It confirms material discontinuation in an objective, industry-accepted format .\nQ169: Carrier says: \n“We’ll allow repair with different dimensions.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric\nAnswer (with source):\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric sizes do not align, leaving sealant strips misaligned and vulnerable. Repairs are unsafe; full replacement is required .\nQ170: Homeowner asks: \n“Can insurance force me to accept mismatched materials?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — insurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nNo, insurance cannot force mismatched repairs. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding and roofing are not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in policy. You’re entitled to full replacement .\nQ171: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just caulk or seal damaged shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCaulking is not manufacturer-approved repair; voids warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed caulking damaged shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, caulking is not an approved repair method and voids warranty. Replacement is required .\nQ172: Carrier says: \n“We won’t accept discontinued list as evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDiscontinued list + iTel confirm no replacement available .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. When paired with iTel lab testing, the Discontinued Shingle List confirms no suitable replacement is available. Together, they provide conclusive proof .\nQ173: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens if we can’t match?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode and regulations require full replacement when mismatching .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf a match isn’t possible, full replacement is required. Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 confirms that mismatched siding or roofing isn’t acceptable unless excluded in the policy .\nQ174: Adjuster says: \n“We can reuse discontinued shingles from repair stock.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStored shingles won’t align in color/age; still discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested using repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\nQ175: Carrier says:\nusing repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\nQ175: Carrier says: \n“We’ll patch siding with leftover stock.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nLeftover siding won’t match aged/weathered walls; iTel confirms discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested using leftover siding stock. These pieces won’t match weathered siding on the home, and the iTel report confirms the line is discontinued. Patching with leftovers does not restore pre-loss condition .\nQ176: Question: \nWhen should the Arbitration Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier denies all appeals and homeowner seeks neutral review .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Arbitration Template should be used when all internal appeals with the insurance company have been exhausted and the carrier maintains denial. It initiates a neutral review process where an arbitrator evaluates the dispute. This forces the carrier to defend their denial against documented evidence .\nQ177: Carrier says: \n“Denial is final and not appealable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is a valid escalation option under policy rights .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the denial is final. Per the Arbitration Information template, the policyholder maintains the right to escalate unresolved disputes through arbitration. This process ensures fair claim handling beyond internal review .\nQ178: Homeowner asks: \n“What is arbitration?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is a neutral third-party review of the claim .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nArbitration is when a neutral third-party arbitrator reviews the evidence from both sides — homeowner and carrier — and makes a binding or advisory decision. It’s an escalation step if the carrier refuses to honor valid claim documentation .\nQ179: Carrier says: \n“Arbitration doesn’t apply here.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIf policy includes arbitration, carrier must participate .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration. If the policy includes arbitration provisions, the carrier must participate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and\nparticipate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and still binding .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nArbitration avoids the delays and costs of lawsuits while still offering neutral review. It’s faster, more affordable, and often binding depending on policy terms. The Arbitration Template helps initiate this option effectively .\nQ181: Question: \nWhen should Complaint Forms be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier mishandles claim or refuses fair handling .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nComplaint Forms should be used when an insurance company delays, denies, or mishandles a claim unfairly. Filing with the state insurance administration creates oversight and pressures carriers to comply with fair claims practices .\nQ182: Carrier says: \n“State complaints won’t change our decision.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints trigger regulatory oversight carriers must respond to .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints won’t matter. Filing a state complaint forces regulatory oversight. Carriers must respond to the state authority, creating accountability in claim handling .\nQ183: Homeowner asks: \n“What happens after I file a complaint?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe state reviews carrier actions and demands formal response .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nAfter you file a complaint, the state insurance administration reviews the carrier’s handling of your claim. The carrier must provide a formal written response. This often leads to claim reconsideration .\nQ184: Adjuster says: \n“Complaints are just paperwork.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints document mishandling and force carrier accountability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed complaints as meaningless. In fact, complaints document mishandling and force accountability under state oversight. Carriers must provide a formal justification, often leading to fairer outcomes .\nQ185: Homeowner asks: \n“Will filing a complaint hurt my claim?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — it enforces fair handling and protects your rights .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\nQ186: Carrier says: \n“We don’t recognize\nTraining Draft):\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\nQ186: Carrier says: \n“We don’t recognize state complaints.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCarriers are required by law to respond to complaints .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you don’t recognize state complaints. By law, carriers must respond to oversight inquiries. Filing a Complaint Form compels this response and ensures review of claim handling .\nQ187: Question: \nWhen should both Arbitration and Complaint Forms be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when carrier refuses reconsideration and claim is unresolved .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nBoth Arbitration and Complaint Forms should be used when a carrier refuses reconsideration despite documentation. Arbitration applies policy provisions for neutral review, while complaints trigger state oversight. Together, they maximize pressure for resolution .\nQ188: Homeowner asks: \n“Which should I do first: arbitration or complaint?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaint first for oversight; arbitration if still unresolved .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nGenerally, filing a complaint first is recommended because it creates regulatory oversight. If the carrier still refuses, then proceed to arbitration. Both paths are valid, but this order applies the most pressure .\nQ189: Carrier says: \n“We won’t change claim regardless of oversight.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOversight and arbitration hold carriers accountable by law .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated oversight won’t affect your decision. State regulators and arbitration provisions exist specifically to hold carriers accountable. Ignoring either is a violation of fair claim handling .\nQ190: Homeowner asks: \n“Do many people file complaints?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nYes — complaints are common and effective for unfair denials .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nYes, many homeowners file complaints when claims are unfairly denied or delayed. The Complaint Form process is standard and often leads to faster, fairer resolution .\nQ191: Carrier says: \n“We won’t respond to arbitration.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPolicy provisions require participation once initiated .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\nrequire participation once initiated .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\nQ192: Adjuster says: \n“Arbitration is just advisory.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMany arbitration decisions are binding per policy terms .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said arbitration is advisory only. Many policies make arbitration binding. Even when advisory, arbitrators’ decisions strongly influence resolution. The Arbitration Template enforces this right .\nQ193: Homeowner asks: \n“What if complaint doesn’t work?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nProceed to arbitration or escalate legally .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nIf a complaint doesn’t resolve the issue, the next step is arbitration or legal escalation. Complaints create oversight, but arbitration provides binding or advisory resolution if denial persists .\nQ194: Carrier says: \n“Customer has no further rights.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCustomer has right to complaint, arbitration, and legal action .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the customer has no further rights. In fact, policyholders maintain the right to complaints, arbitration, and legal remedies. Denying these rights is a violation of fair claims practices .\nQ195: Homeowner asks: \n“Is complaint filing complicated?”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNo — forms are simple and Roof-ER provides guidance .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nFiling a complaint is straightforward. The forms are simple, and Roof-ER provides the homeowner with templates and step-by-step guidance. The Complaint Forms make the process efficient .\nQ196: Adjuster says: \n“Complaints waste time.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nComplaints are official state action carriers must respond to .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve said complaints waste time. In reality, complaints initiate state action that requires a carrier response.

    "content": "Insurance Pushback & Arguments Playbook (Q1–Q100)\nQ1: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see enough damage to warrant replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report shows functional storm damage (creases, missing shingles) beyond repair. This requires full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nPlease see the attached photo report documenting storm-related damage on multiple slopes. The photos clearly show creased and missing shingles, which are consistent with functional wind damage and cannot be repaired without causing further harm. Per standard industry practice, this constitutes irreparability, and a full replacement is required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. We respectfully request that your estimate be revised accordingly .\nQ2: Adjuster says: \n“Hail is cosmetic and doesn’t affect function.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHail damage is not cosmetic — it causes granule loss, mat fractures, and sealant bond failures, per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states that hail damage is cosmetic only. However, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, hail impact causes functional issues such as granule loss, cracks in the asphalt mat, and compromised sealant bonds. These defects accelerate roof deterioration and shorten lifespan, making the roof irreparable. For these reasons, this damage cannot be dismissed as cosmetic. Please update your estimate to reflect full roof replacement .\nQ3: Carrier says: \n“Shingles can be patched.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued; patching would cause mismatches and fail manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour position that the roof can be patched is not consistent with the findings of the attached iTel report, which confirms that the installed shingles are discontinued. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, no comparable replacements exist. Mixing discontinued shingles with available alternatives creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant bond, violating manufacturer standards. The only viable and code-compliant option is full replacement .\nQ4: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see storm-related damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the\nphoto report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the attached photo report, which documents collateral impacts to gutters, soft metals, and shingles. These damage patterns are consistent with the storm event reported and align with industry-recognized storm signatures. Additionally, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, latent damage from wind or hail may not be visible immediately but still compromises long-term performance. We ask that the scope be reconsidered with this evidence in mind .\nQ5: Carrier says: \n“The roof is still functional.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCoverage isn’t based on functionality — cracked shingles and exposed mats void warranties and require replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nWhile you noted the roof is “still functional,” coverage is not determined by whether a roof is currently leaking but by restoring the property to its pre-loss condition. The attached documentation shows cracked shingles and exposed fiberglass mats. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, these conditions void the manufacturer’s warranty and compromise the integrity of the system. Repair is not feasible, and replacement is required to bring the property back to pre-storm condition .\nQ6: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover storm tarp nail holes.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer GAF, tarping through shingles permanently damages them. Caulking nail holes is not an acceptable repair .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes coverage for tarp-related nail holes. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, any roof that has been nailed through during tarping has been permanently compromised. Caulking these penetrations is not a permanent repair and creates a maintenance issue outside warranty coverage. The shingles with nail holes must be replaced to ensure a watertight system .\nQ7: Carrier says: \n“Damage is old, not storm-related.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur timestamped photo report shows fresh granule loss and collateral consistent with the reported storm .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests the roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized\nthe roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized and patterned. These conditions confirm storm-related damage .\nQ8: Adjuster says: \n“Denial stands, no additional inspection.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe homeowner may request a second inspection and has provided new documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nWe respectfully request a second inspection on behalf of the homeowner. The customer-to-insurance template letter has been provided and highlights overlooked damage supported by our documentation. Denying reinspection ignores the policyholder’s right to fair claim handling. Please reconsider based on this new evidence .\nQ9: Carrier says: \n“No damage to soft metals = no hail event.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report shows dents in metals. Even without collateral, GAF confirms hail causes latent shingle damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou denied hail damage based on an absence of collateral. The attached photo report shows visible dents to soft metals. Furthermore, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, shingles can sustain latent damage (fractures, granule loss, bond failures) even without collateral evidence. The absence of extensive metal damage does not rule out functional hail damage to shingles .\nQ10: Adjuster says: \n“Your test was unnecessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is industry standard. Our video shows shingles cracked during manipulation, proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nOur brittle test was necessary to confirm whether repair was feasible. The documented repair attempt video shows the shingles fractured during manipulation, a clear indicator of irreparability. This aligns with accepted industry standards for testing storm-damaged shingles. Repair is not possible; full replacement is the only solution .\nQ11: Carrier says: \n“Your documentation isn’t sufficient.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe’ve provided photo report, repair attempt, and iTel report — proving irreparability and discontinuation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:\nA photo report showing storm-related damage.\n\nA repair attempt video proving irreparability.\n\nAn iTel report confirming discontinuation of the sh\n(Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:\nA photo report showing storm-related damage.\n\nA repair attempt video proving irreparability.\n\nAn iTel report confirming discontinuation of the shingles.\n\n Together, these documents establish that the roof cannot be repaired, only replaced .\n\nQ12: Adjuster says: \n“The roof is patchable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing discontinued English-dimension shingles with metric shingles misaligns sealant, violating manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests patching is possible. The attached iTel report confirms the existing shingles are English dimension and discontinued. New shingles are only available in metric sizing, which misaligns sealant strips and prevents proper bonding. Manufacturer installation standards prohibit mixing dimensions, making patching non-viable .\nQ13: Carrier says: \n“No coverage for siding mismatch.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 requires siding replacement unless policy explicitly excludes it .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial of siding mismatch coverage contradicts Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, which requires carriers to provide for siding replacement unless policies specifically exclude matching. The damaged siding is discontinued, and no suitable matches are available. Full elevation replacement is required .\nQ14: Adjuster says: \n“We only pay Actual Cash Value, not replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nReplacement cost policies require restoring pre-loss condition. Patch repairs with discontinued shingles don’t qualify .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve indicated coverage is limited to ACV only. This property carries replacement cost coverage, which requires restoring it to pre-loss condition. Since the shingles are discontinued, patch repairs are impossible without mismatching and lowering value. Full replacement is the only way to honor policy terms .\nQ15: Carrier says: \n“No hail large enough reported.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNOAA data and our photos show functional hail damage. Size is irrelevant once damage exists .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial cites no reported hail size sufficient for damage. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .\n. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .\nQ16: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during re-roofing .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code 908.5, all rusted, damaged, or deteriorated flashings must be replaced when re-roofing. Attempting to reuse old flashings violates code and creates long-term risk. Replacement must be included .\nQ17: Carrier says: \n“Granule loss is normal aging.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF states storm-related granule loss exposes asphalt and accelerates failure .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial attributes granule loss to aging. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granule loss from hail or wind exposes the asphalt mat, accelerating deterioration and causing premature failure. This is storm-related functional damage, not normal wear .\nQ18: Adjuster says: \n“Repairs will hold fine.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur repair attempt already failed — shingles cracked during manipulation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated repairs will hold. However, our documented repair attempt shows shingles cracking when lifted, confirming brittleness. Repairs would cause further damage and are not viable. Replacement is required .\nQ19: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for collateral damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) proves storm impact and supports full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes collateral. Our photo report documents storm-related impacts to gutters, metals, and siding. Collateral damage proves storm impact, strengthens the claim, and requires coverage to restore the property fully .\nQ20: Adjuster says: \n“Denial is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHomeowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer\nowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer resolution at this stage and urge reconsideration with the new documentation provided .\nQ21: Carrier says: \n“We don’t accept contractor reports.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur iTel and photo reports are third-party verified industry standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated contractor reports are insufficient. Please note, the iTel report is a third-party laboratory analysis, and our photo report follows standard claim documentation procedures. These are accepted industry documents and valid evidence of storm damage .\nQ22: Adjuster says: \n“We see no storm date evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur report is timestamped and consistent with NOAA storm data .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial cites no storm date evidence. Our photo report is timestamped and aligns with NOAA storm data for this location and date. The pattern and extent of the damage confirm storm causation .\nQ23: Carrier says: \n“Your estimate exceeds fair market value.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur estimate includes mandatory code items like flashing and WRB per VA & MD code .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our estimate exceeds market value. Please note the estimate includes mandatory code items: flashing per VA Code 908.5 and water-resistive barriers per MD Code R703. These are required by law and must be included in the scope .\nQ24: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires underlayment to overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6″. Reuse isn’t allowed .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes underlayment. Per GAF Slope Replacement Guidelines, when replacing a single plane, underlayment must overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6 inches. Reusing old material is not permitted, and proper installation requires new underlayment .\nQ25: Carrier says: \n“We won’t reopen this claim.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the\n: Carrier says: \n“We won’t reopen this claim.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the claim cannot be reopened. However, we’ve provided new documentation: a repair attempt video confirming irreparability, an iTel report verifying discontinuation, and a photo report documenting storm damage. This new evidence requires reconsideration under the policyholder’s rights .\nQ26: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll replace the back slope only, not the entire roof.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer GAF slope replacement requirements, underlayment and ridge/hip work cannot be isolated — full replacement is required .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only the back slope for replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, replacing a single slope requires removing and overlapping underlayment at ridge and hip connections, which compromises adjoining slopes. This process makes isolated slope replacement impractical and risks system failure. A full replacement is required to maintain roof integrity .\nQ27: Carrier says: \n“We only saw damage on the front slope.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStorms impact all slopes. Our photo report shows consistent collateral across multiple slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour approval of only the front slope does not reflect the actual storm damage. Our attached photo report documents consistent collateral and shingle damage across multiple slopes. Storm exposure is not limited to a single elevation. To restore the property, all slopes must be included .\nQ28: Adjuster says: \n“Only one siding elevation is covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland law requires full replacement when matching is impossible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only one elevation for siding replacement. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in the policy. The damaged siding is discontinued, and matching is impossible. Full elevation replacement is required .\nQ29: Carrier says: \n“We don’t see gutter damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows collateral gutter impacts consistent with roof damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial omits gutters. Our photo report documents dents and granule washout in the gutters consistent with roof storm damage. Collateral gutter damage confirms storm\nwith roof damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial omits gutters. Our photo report documents dents and granule washout in the gutters consistent with roof storm damage. Collateral gutter damage confirms storm impact and must be included in the scope .\nQ30: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover downspouts.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDownspouts show hail dents and granule buildup. They are storm-damaged and must be replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes downspouts. Our attached photo documentation shows clear hail dents and granule buildup at downspout terminations. These are storm-related damages that shorten system life.

These items are mandatory and must be included to bring the property into compliance .\nInsurance Pushback & Arguments Playbook (Q1–Q100)\nQ1: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see enough damage to warrant replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report shows functional storm damage (creases, missing shingles) beyond repair. This requires full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nPlease see the attached photo report documenting storm-related damage on multiple slopes. The photos clearly show creased and missing shingles, which are consistent with functional wind damage and cannot be repaired without causing further harm. Per standard industry practice, this constitutes irreparability, and a full replacement is required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. We respectfully request that your estimate be revised accordingly .\nQ2: Adjuster says: \n“Hail is cosmetic and doesn’t affect function.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHail damage is not cosmetic — it causes granule loss, mat fractures, and sealant bond failures, per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states that hail damage is cosmetic only. However, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, hail impact causes functional issues such as granule loss, cracks in the asphalt mat, and compromised sealant bonds. These defects accelerate roof deterioration and shorten lifespan, making the roof irreparable. For these reasons, this damage cannot be dismissed as cosmetic. Please update your estimate to reflect full roof replacement .\nQ3: Carrier says: \n“Shingles can be patched.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued; patching would cause mismatches and fail manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour position that the roof can be patched is not consistent with the findings of the attached iTel report, which confirms that the installed shingles are discontinued. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, no comparable replacements exist. Mixing discontinued shingles with available alternatives creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant bond, violating manufacturer standards. The only viable and code-compliant option is full replacement .\nQ4: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t see storm-related damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the\nphoto report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the attached photo report, which documents collateral impacts to gutters, soft metals, and shingles. These damage patterns are consistent with the storm event reported and align with industry-recognized storm signatures. Additionally, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, latent damage from wind or hail may not be visible immediately but still compromises long-term performance. We ask that the scope be reconsidered with this evidence in mind .\nQ5: Carrier says: \n“The roof is still functional.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCoverage isn’t based on functionality — cracked shingles and exposed mats void warranties and require replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nWhile you noted the roof is “still functional,” coverage is not determined by whether a roof is currently leaking but by restoring the property to its pre-loss condition. The attached documentation shows cracked shingles and exposed fiberglass mats. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, these conditions void the manufacturer’s warranty and compromise the integrity of the system. Repair is not feasible, and replacement is required to bring the property back to pre-storm condition .\nQ6: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover storm tarp nail holes.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer GAF, tarping through shingles permanently damages them. Caulking nail holes is not an acceptable repair .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes coverage for tarp-related nail holes. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, any roof that has been nailed through during tarping has been permanently compromised. Caulking these penetrations is not a permanent repair and creates a maintenance issue outside warranty coverage. The shingles with nail holes must be replaced to ensure a watertight system .\nQ7: Carrier says: \n“Damage is old, not storm-related.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur timestamped photo report shows fresh granule loss and collateral consistent with the reported storm .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests the roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized\nthe roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized and patterned. These conditions confirm storm-related damage .\nQ8: Adjuster says: \n“Denial stands, no additional inspection.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe homeowner may request a second inspection and has provided new documentation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nWe respectfully request a second inspection on behalf of the homeowner. The customer-to-insurance template letter has been provided and highlights overlooked damage supported by our documentation. Denying reinspection ignores the policyholder’s right to fair claim handling. Please reconsider based on this new evidence .\nQ9: Carrier says: \n“No damage to soft metals = no hail event.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report shows dents in metals. Even without collateral, GAF confirms hail causes latent shingle damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou denied hail damage based on an absence of collateral. The attached photo report shows visible dents to soft metals. Furthermore, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, shingles can sustain latent damage (fractures, granule loss, bond failures) even without collateral evidence. The absence of extensive metal damage does not rule out functional hail damage to shingles .\nQ10: Adjuster says: \n“Your test was unnecessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is industry standard. Our video shows shingles cracked during manipulation, proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nOur brittle test was necessary to confirm whether repair was feasible. The documented repair attempt video shows the shingles fractured during manipulation, a clear indicator of irreparability. This aligns with accepted industry standards for testing storm-damaged shingles. Repair is not possible; full replacement is the only solution .\nQ11: Carrier says: \n“Your documentation isn’t sufficient.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nWe’ve provided photo report, repair attempt, and iTel report — proving irreparability and discontinuation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:\nA photo report showing storm-related damage.\n\nA repair attempt video proving irreparability.\n\nAn iTel report confirming discontinuation of the sh\n(Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:\nA photo report showing storm-related damage.\n\nA repair attempt video proving irreparability.\n\nAn iTel report confirming discontinuation of the shingles.\n\n Together, these documents establish that the roof cannot be repaired, only replaced .\n\nQ12: Adjuster says: \n“The roof is patchable.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing discontinued English-dimension shingles with metric shingles misaligns sealant, violating manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests patching is possible. The attached iTel report confirms the existing shingles are English dimension and discontinued. New shingles are only available in metric sizing, which misaligns sealant strips and prevents proper bonding. Manufacturer installation standards prohibit mixing dimensions, making patching non-viable .\nQ13: Carrier says: \n“No coverage for siding mismatch.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 requires siding replacement unless policy explicitly excludes it .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial of siding mismatch coverage contradicts Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, which requires carriers to provide for siding replacement unless policies specifically exclude matching. The damaged siding is discontinued, and no suitable matches are available. Full elevation replacement is required .\nQ14: Adjuster says: \n“We only pay Actual Cash Value, not replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nReplacement cost policies require restoring pre-loss condition. Patch repairs with discontinued shingles don’t qualify .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve indicated coverage is limited to ACV only. This property carries replacement cost coverage, which requires restoring it to pre-loss condition. Since the shingles are discontinued, patch repairs are impossible without mismatching and lowering value. Full replacement is the only way to honor policy terms .\nQ15: Carrier says: \n“No hail large enough reported.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNOAA data and our photos show functional hail damage. Size is irrelevant once damage exists .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial cites no reported hail size sufficient for damage. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .\n. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .\nQ16: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t cover flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during re-roofing .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code 908.5, all rusted, damaged, or deteriorated flashings must be replaced when re-roofing. Attempting to reuse old flashings violates code and creates long-term risk. Replacement must be included .\nQ17: Carrier says: \n“Granule loss is normal aging.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF states storm-related granule loss exposes asphalt and accelerates failure .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial attributes granule loss to aging. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granule loss from hail or wind exposes the asphalt mat, accelerating deterioration and causing premature failure. This is storm-related functional damage, not normal wear .\nQ18: Adjuster says: \n“Repairs will hold fine.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur repair attempt already failed — shingles cracked during manipulation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated repairs will hold. However, our documented repair attempt shows shingles cracking when lifted, confirming brittleness. Repairs would cause further damage and are not viable. Replacement is required .\nQ19: Carrier says: \n“We don’t pay for collateral damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) proves storm impact and supports full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes collateral. Our photo report documents storm-related impacts to gutters, metals, and siding. Collateral damage proves storm impact, strengthens the claim, and requires coverage to restore the property fully .\nQ20: Adjuster says: \n“Denial is final.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHomeowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer\nowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer resolution at this stage and urge reconsideration with the new documentation provided .\nQ21: Carrier says: \n“We don’t accept contractor reports.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur iTel and photo reports are third-party verified industry standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated contractor reports are insufficient. Please note, the iTel report is a third-party laboratory analysis, and our photo report follows standard claim documentation procedures. These are accepted industry documents and valid evidence of storm damage .\nQ22: Adjuster says: \n“We see no storm date evidence.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur report is timestamped and consistent with NOAA storm data .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial cites no storm date evidence. Our photo report is timestamped and aligns with NOAA storm data for this location and date. The pattern and extent of the damage confirm storm causation .\nQ23: Carrier says: \n“Your estimate exceeds fair market value.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur estimate includes mandatory code items like flashing and WRB per VA & MD code .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our estimate exceeds market value. Please note the estimate includes mandatory code items: flashing per VA Code 908.5 and water-resistive barriers per MD Code R703. These are required by law and must be included in the scope .\nQ24: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires underlayment to overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6″. Reuse isn’t allowed .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes underlayment. Per GAF Slope Replacement Guidelines, when replacing a single plane, underlayment must overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6 inches. Reusing old material is not permitted, and proper installation requires new underlayment .\nQ25: Carrier says: \n“We won’t reopen this claim.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the\n: Carrier says: \n“We won’t reopen this claim.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nNew evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated the claim cannot be reopened. However, we’ve provided new documentation: a repair attempt video confirming irreparability, an iTel report verifying discontinuation, and a photo report documenting storm damage. This new evidence requires reconsideration under the policyholder’s rights .\nQ26: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll replace the back slope only, not the entire roof.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPer GAF slope replacement requirements, underlayment and ridge/hip work cannot be isolated — full replacement is required .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only the back slope for replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, replacing a single slope requires removing and overlapping underlayment at ridge and hip connections, which compromises adjoining slopes. This process makes isolated slope replacement impractical and risks system failure. A full replacement is required to maintain roof integrity .\nQ27: Carrier says: \n“We only saw damage on the front slope.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStorms impact all slopes. Our photo report shows consistent collateral across multiple slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour approval of only the front slope does not reflect the actual storm damage. Our attached photo report documents consistent collateral and shingle damage across multiple slopes. Storm exposure is not limited to a single elevation. To restore the property, all slopes must be included .\nQ28: Adjuster says: \n“Only one siding elevation is covered.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland law requires full replacement when matching is impossible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved only one elevation for siding replacement. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in the policy. The damaged siding is discontinued, and matching is impossible. Full elevation replacement is required .\nQ29: Carrier says: \n“We don’t see gutter damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPhoto report shows collateral gutter impacts consistent with roof damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial omits gutters. Our photo report documents dents and granule washout in the gutters consistent with roof storm damage. Collateral gutter damage confirms storm\nwith roof damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial omits gutters. Our photo report documents dents and granule washout in the gutters consistent with roof storm damage. Collateral gutter damage confirms storm impact and must be included in the scope .\nQ30: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover downspouts.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nDownspouts show hail dents and granule buildup. They are storm-damaged and must be replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes downspouts. Our attached photo documentation shows clear hail dents and granule buildup at downspout terminations. These are storm-related damages that shorten system life. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .\nQ31: Carrier says: \n“We’ll approve roof but not siding.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStorm caused both roof and siding damage. Code and matching requirements apply .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved roof replacement but denied siding. The storm impacted both systems. Per our siding argument documentation and Maryland matching requirements, partial siding replacement creates mismatches and fails to restore the home properly. Siding must be included .\nQ32: Adjuster says: \n“Only approving half of siding wall.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRemoving corner posts requires detaching full wall, causing consequential damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve limited siding replacement to half a wall. Per our siding argument documentation, removing corner posts and reinstalling panels causes consequential damage that requires full wall replacement. Partial approval is not feasible .\nQ33: Carrier says: \n“We only cover wind-damaged shingles, not hail.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur photo report documents both hail and wind impacts; both require coverage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve covered wind damage but excluded hail. The attached photo report documents both creased shingles (wind) and circular divots with granule loss (hail). Per GAF Storm Guidelines, hail damage is functional, not cosmetic. Both perils must be covered .\nQ34: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code requires flashing replacement when deteriorated or rusted .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code\n: \n“We’ll cover roof but not flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code requires flashing replacement when deteriorated or rusted .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code 908.5, any rusted, damaged, or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during reroofing. Code compliance requires flashing be included in the scope .\nQ35: Carrier says: \n“No siding wrap needed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMaryland Code R703 requires WRB behind siding .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded housewrap. Per Maryland Exterior Wall Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting this violates code and risks moisture intrusion. WRB must be included .\nQ36: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover slope but not ridge cap.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nReplacing a slope requires ridge cap removal; reuse voids manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved slope replacement but excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed during slope replacement and cannot be reinstalled without voiding warranty. Ridge caps must be included .\nQ37: Carrier says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not underlayment.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires new underlayment overlap when replacing slopes .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF technical bulletin TAB-R-164, when replacing a slope, underlayment must extend 4–6 inches into adjoining slopes. Reuse is prohibited. Underlayment replacement is required .\nQ38: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll only replace one plane of siding.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode requires WRB overlap across corners; partial wall replacement isn’t feasible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve limited siding replacement to one plane. Per Maryland Code R703, WRB must overlap 6 inches at joints and corners, which requires removal of adjacent siding. Partial replacement is not feasible and violates code .\nQ39: Carrier says: \n“We won’t cover ventilation removal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires ridge ventilation be removed when adjoining slopes are replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes ventilation. Per GAF Slo\nsays: \n“We won’t cover ventilation removal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nGAF requires ridge ventilation be removed when adjoining slopes are replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes ventilation. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing adjoining slopes. They cannot be reused without risking water intrusion. Ventilation must be included .\nQ40: Adjuster says: \n“We don’t owe for drip edge.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nInternational Residential Code requires drip edge at eaves and rakes for asphalt shingles .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded drip edge. Per the Virginia adopted IRC, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes on asphalt shingle installations. This is a code-mandated component and must be included .\nQ41: Carrier says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not valley metal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code requires valley flashing be replaced when deteriorated .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes valley flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, deteriorated flashing, including valleys, must be replaced when reroofing. Valley metal must be included in scope .\nQ42: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll cover slope but not hip shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHip shingles must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reinstalled .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved slope replacement but excluded hips. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, hip shingles must be removed when adjoining slopes are replaced. They cannot be reused; new hip shingles are required .\nQ43: Carrier says: \n“Only slope replacement, no ice/water shield.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIce/water shield required at eaves in snow-prone areas per IRC .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied ice/water shield. Per the IRC as adopted in Virginia, ice barrier underlayment is required at eaves in regions subject to ice dams. This must be included for code compliance .\nQ44: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover ridge vent replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vents must be removed for adjoining slope work and cannot be reused .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope\ncover ridge vent replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge vents must be removed for adjoining slope work and cannot be reused .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed during adjoining slope replacement. Reuse compromises performance and violates manufacturer instructions. Ridge vent replacement must be included .\nQ45: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nManufacturer guidelines require starter strips on eaves and rakes for wind warranty .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF installation standards, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind resistance warranty coverage. Starter shingles are a mandatory component .\nQ46: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover ridge caps because they look fine.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRidge caps must be removed when slopes are replaced; reinstallation voids coverage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed to install new underlayment and shingles. Once removed, they cannot be reused without voiding warranty. New ridge caps must be included .\nQ47: Carrier says: \n“We don’t cover step flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVA Code requires replacement of damaged flashing during reroofing .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes step flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, existing flashings that are rusted, damaged, or deteriorated must be replaced when reroofing. Step flashing is integral and cannot be reused .\nQ48: Adjuster says: \n“Only covering roof plane, not chimney flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCode requires flashing at all penetrations; chimney flashing must be replaced .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded chimney flashing. Per IRC R703.4 as adopted in Maryland, flashing must be installed at all penetrations to prevent water entry. Chimney flashing replacement is required for compliance .\nQ49: Carrier says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not fascia metal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral fascia dents documented in photo report prove storm damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded fasc\nCarrier says: \n“We’ll cover roof but not fascia metal.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nCollateral fascia dents documented in photo report prove storm damage .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve excluded fascia metal. Our attached photo report shows dents and creasing consistent with storm impact. Collateral damage must be included for proper restoration .\nQ50: Adjuster says: \n“We won’t cover skylight flashing.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nFlashing at penetrations must be replaced per code; skylights cannot be reused with old flashing .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations to prevent water intrusion. Skylight flashing cannot be reused once disturbed and must be replaced to maintain watertightness .\nQ51: Adjuster says: \n“We can repair by lifting shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur repair attempt video shows shingles cracked during lifting — proving brittleness .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested repairs by lifting shingles. We attempted this, and the repair attempt video shows shingles cracking and breaking when lifted. This confirms brittleness and irreparability. Replacement is the only feasible option to restore the property .\nQ52: Carrier says: \n“Try a patch first.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPatch test failed — new shingles don’t align with existing sealant strips .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial requests a patch attempt. We attempted repair, and the shingles fractured upon manipulation. Further, per the iTel report, the existing shingles are discontinued and English dimension, while replacements are metric. This creates misaligned sealant strips and voids manufacturer warranty. Repairs are not possible .\nQ53: Adjuster says: \n“You didn’t prove repair wasn’t possible.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempt caused more damage — documented in video .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou stated we did not prove repairs impossible. Our repair attempt video shows that when shingles were lifted, they tore and fractured. This damage is conclusive evidence of irreparability. Replacement is required .\nQ54: Carrier says: \n“Repairs will be minor.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven minor repairs cracked shingles, confirming brit\nlifted, they tore and fractured. This damage is conclusive evidence of irreparability. Replacement is required .\nQ54: Carrier says: \n“Repairs will be minor.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nEven minor repairs cracked shingles, confirming brittleness .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests only minor repairs are needed. We attempted such repairs, and even slight lifting of shingles caused cracking. This proves brittleness and irreparability. Minor repairs are not an option .\nQ55: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll repair siding with a panel swap.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRemoving siding panels damages adjoining ones, requiring full wall replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou proposed repairing siding by swapping panels. Per our siding argument documentation, removing individual panels requires detaching corner posts and adjoining panels, causing consequential damage. This makes partial repair infeasible. Full replacement is required .\nQ56: Carrier says: \n“Corner post removal is simple.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRemoving corner posts causes consequential siding damage per siding repair standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested corner post removal is minor. In reality, per our siding argument, removing corner posts necessitates detaching full wall sections of siding. This process causes consequential damage and makes simple repairs impossible .\nQ57: Adjuster says: \n“We can reuse siding panels.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSiding panels distort and crack when removed, making reuse impossible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated siding panels can be reused. However, per our siding argument documentation, panels crack and distort when removed due to interlocking mechanisms. Reuse compromises fit and watertightness. Replacement is required .\nQ58: Carrier says: \n“Repair attempt wasn’t needed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard to confirm irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair tests are industry standard to confirm whether patching is possible. Our attempt caused additional shingle damage, proving irreparability. Replacement is justified .\nQ59: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll approve repair of flashing only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStep and counter flashing cannot be removed without damaging siding/roof .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve\n.\nQ59: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll approve repair of flashing only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nStep and counter flashing cannot be removed without damaging siding/roof .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved flashing repair only. Per VA code and flashing installation requirements, step and counter flashing are integrated into siding and roof coverings. They cannot be removed or repaired without causing consequential damage. Full replacement is necessary .\nQ60: Carrier says: \n“We’ll approve spot shingle replacement.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSpot repairs cracked shingles and failed brittle test .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial suggests spot shingle replacement. Our repair attempt shows that individual shingle replacement caused additional cracking. Spot repair failed brittle testing and is not feasible. Full slope replacement is required .\nQ61: Adjuster says: \n“Metal roof can be spot repaired.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMetal panels interlock; removal damages adjoining panels .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated metal roofing can be spot repaired. Per our photo documentation, metal panels interlock, and removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing distortion. Spot repair is not feasible; replacement is necessary .\nQ62: Carrier says: \n“Flat roof can be patched.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nPatching violates manufacturer warranty; full system integrity is required .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested patching the flat roof. Per state code and manufacturer requirements, patching voids warranty and does not restore system integrity. Full section replacement is required to comply with building code .\nQ63: Adjuster says: \n“Aluminum siding can be spot replaced.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nAluminum siding dents cannot be corrected; matching profiles are discontinued .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested spot replacement for aluminum siding. Aluminum dents cannot be repaired, and per our siding argument, profiles are discontinued and mismatches inevitable. Full replacement is required .\nQ64: Carrier says: \n“Vinyl siding repair is simple.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nVinyl becomes brittle with age; removal cracks panels .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve described vinyl siding repair as simple. In reality, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks during removal. This is documented in our siding argument evidence. Repair is\nage; removal cracks panels .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve described vinyl siding repair as simple. In reality, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks during removal. This is documented in our siding argument evidence. Repair is not feasible without causing more damage .\nQ65: Adjuster says: \n“Shingle repairs are safe.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOur repair test shows cracking and sealant failure during attempts .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated repairs are safe. Our repair attempt shows cracking, sealant separation, and additional damage during attempted repairs. This is proof repairs are not safe or viable. Full replacement is required .\nQ66: Carrier says: \n“We can repair skylight flashing only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSkylight flashing cannot be reused once removed; requires replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved flashing repair only. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be watertight at penetrations. Skylight flashing cannot be reused once disturbed and must be replaced to maintain integrity .\nQ67: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll replace individual tabs only.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nTabs cracked during repair attempt, confirming irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested replacing individual shingle tabs. Our repair attempt showed that lifting tabs caused cracking and separation. This confirms irreparability. Replacement is required .\nQ68: Carrier says: \n“Your brittle test isn’t valid.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nBrittle testing is industry standard and widely accepted .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve dismissed our brittle test. Repair attempt testing is an accepted industry standard to determine shingle reparability. The documented cracking during our test confirms irreparability and requires replacement .\nQ69: Adjuster says: \n“Sealant re-bonding solves repair issues.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSealant strips failed to re-bond in repair attempt; warranty voided .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated sealant re-bonding solves issues. Our repair attempt shows sealant strips did not re-bond after lifting, leaving the shingles vulnerable to wind uplift. Manufacturer warranties are void in this condition. Replacement is required .\nQ70: Carrier says: \n“We’ll use alternate manufacturer shingles.”\nrepair attempt shows sealant strips did not re-bond after lifting, leaving the shingles vulnerable to wind uplift. Manufacturer warranties are void in this condition. Replacement is required .\nQ70: Carrier says: \n“We’ll use alternate manufacturer shingles.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMixing manufacturers violates warranty and creates mismatches .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested alternate manufacturer shingles. The iTel report confirms no acceptable match exists. Mixing shingles from different manufacturers violates warranty and causes visual and structural mismatches. Replacement is required .\nQ71: Adjuster says: \n“Your test caused the damage.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempt cracking is proof of brittleness, not damage creation .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve stated our repair test caused the damage. In fact, the cracking during the repair attempt is conclusive evidence of brittleness and irreparability. Industry standards support testing as proof of storm-related failure .\nQ72: Carrier says: \n“Aluminum wrap can be reused.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nAluminum wrap is distorted once removed and cannot be reused .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve proposed reusing aluminum wrap. Per our siding argument documentation, aluminum wrap distorts when removed and cannot be reused. Replacement is the only feasible option .\nQ73: Adjuster says: \n“You didn’t provide enough repair attempts.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nOne failed repair attempt is sufficient to prove irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve requested multiple repair attempts. Industry practice requires only one documented failed attempt to prove irreparability. Our attempt shows cracking and tearing, confirming repairs are not possible .\nQ74: Carrier says: \n“You can reseal shingles with adhesives.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nAdhesive reseal voids manufacturer warranty and fails under wind load .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested adhesive resealing. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, artificial adhesive use is not an approved method and voids warranty. Wind resistance is reduced, creating liability. Replacement is the only compliant option .\nQ75: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll allow repair, not replacement, on siding.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSiding repair requires removal of full wall wrap; partial repair is impossible .\nDetailed Answer (\nReplacement is the only compliant option .\nQ75: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll allow repair, not replacement, on siding.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nSiding repair requires removal of full wall wrap; partial repair is impossible .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve approved repair only for siding.

Flashing replacement must be included .\nQ78: Carrier says: \n“No housewrap needed.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nMD Code R703 requires water-resistive barriers behind siding .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes housewrap. Per Maryland Code R703, water-resistive barriers are required behind siding to prevent water intrusion. Omitting this component violates state building code and leaves the property noncompliant. Housewrap must be included .\nQ79: Adjuster says: \n“We’ll just replace panels without wrap.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nHousewrap must overlap 6″ at corners, requiring full wall removal .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested panel replacement without addressing housewrap. Per Maryland Code R703, housewrap must overlap at least 6 inches\nmust overlap 6″ at corners, requiring full wall removal .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve suggested panel replacement without addressing housewrap.

Per VA Code 908.5, deteriorated or damaged flashing must be replaced during reroofing. Counter flashing around chimneys and walls falls under this requirement. Replacement is mandatory .\nQ86: Adjuster says: \n“Kick-out flashing isn’t necessary.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIRC requires kick-out flashing at roof-wall intersections .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou’ve denied kick-out flashing. Per IRC R903.2.1, kick-out flashing is required at roof-wall intersections to divert water away from walls. Omission violates code. Kick-out flashing must be included .\nQ87: Carrier says: \n“We don’t owe for chimney cricket.”\nShort Answer (with source):\nIRC requires crickets on chimneys wider than 30″ .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial excludes a chimney cricket. Per IRC R903.2.2, crickets or saddles are required on chimneys wider than 30 inches to divert water.

My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that specializes in helping homeowners get their roof replaced, paid for by their insurance!”  \nGeneric:\n“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Philadelphia/Maryland over the past few months that have done a lot of damage! \n“We’re already working with your neighbors. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof  replaced.”\nInitial Pitch\n“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do,  I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nPause here – Wait for them to respond/agree.\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.\nGo in for a handshake. “What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am (your name).  Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I will give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection. (See Inspection and Post-Inspection Script for detailed next steps.)\nInitial Pitch\nBreak into groups\nSwitch between Sales Rep and Homeowner\nRead the script a few times each\nInitial Pitch\nSpecific\n“Were you home for the storm we had in ___. Wait for answer\nIf yes “It was pretty crazy right?! Wait for answer \nIf no: “Oh no worries at all, we get that all the time.\nIf yes move on to next line marked with *\nIf no “That’s good! It was a pretty bad one.”\n*“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof replaced.”\nInitial Pitch Quiz\nWhat are the 5 Non-Negotiables?\nWhat are the first two sentences of the Initial Pitch?\nWhat are the next 2 in the generic script?\nWhat are the next 3 lines if you are mentioning a specific storm date?\nFill in the blanks: “While I’m here in the neighborhood, I am conducting a _____ _____ ____ __ __ __ __ ____ ______, ________damage.\nWhat are the next 2 sentences after they agree to let you do the inspection?\nWhat is the last sentence of the Initial Pitch Script?\nField Portal App\nThe Field Portal App will be used mostly on your phone (but is also useable on your iPad)\nLater on this week, we will review using the Field Portal App on a laptop or desktop which is the most ideal way to keep your jobs organized\nOn the Field Portal App, you can:\nTrack your jobs and what stage they are in\nReview Metrics\nPin houses and create leads\nCreate and upload your Photo reports\nSchedule customer-related events\nReview Tasks and Messages\nCheck the Trade Calendar to see when your installs are going up\nField Portal App\nPinning Houses\nField Portal App\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view a list of your door knocks.\nObjections\nCommon Objections\n“not interested”\n“I need to talk to my spouse”\n“I don’t have enough time”\n“my roof is in good shape”\n“I just had it checked”\n“I don’t have the money for anything right now”\n“I have a roofer knock my door at least 5 times a week”\n“my roof is only 18 years old and is a 50 year roof”\nTips:\nAlways react positively with an agreeable response and attitude\nAsk questions when appropriate\nRepeat the customers’ objections when appropriate\nInitial Pitch\nWork in groups – try to see how much you have memorized\nInitial Pitch\nPlease memorize the whole Generic initial pitch \nPlease also be familiar with the Specific Pitch\nShingles\nDiscontinued Shingles\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bGenerating New Business\nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\nMake it a goal to knock 70 doors minimum per day\nPin the houses\nTake good (quick) notes\nKNOCK SOME MORE\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bInspections\nConduct the inspection in the order of the inspection\nThink about safety\nIf you do not feel safe, DO NOT DO THE INSPECTION\nAlways ensure ladder is safely placed\nSafety items you should consider:\nCougar Paws (Get this before anything else)\nBungee Cords\nPitch Hopper\nOther roofing items – reach out to discuss additional safety items\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bAdjuster Meeting\nAdjuster meeting typically happens within 2 – 7 days\nYou meet with the insurance adjuster\nYou will also be creating your formal photo report this day\nThe decision from the insurance company usually comes within 1 – 10 business days\nOnce a decision is made, they usually only send the estimate to the homeowner\nEnsure the homeowner is prepped to send this to you if the insurance company does not send it to you\nDon’t worry – we will review this in much more detail later – we just want to ensure you understand the timeline at this point\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bProject Meeting\nAfter you send the estimate to Amber (estimates@theroofdocs.com) and to me, we will begin to review the estimate and conduct what is called a Project Review\nWithin a few days, the job will be assigned to one of our Project Coordinators who will schedule a Project Meeting with your homeowner\nThis typically happens within a week of receiving the estimate\nAfter that meeting, the homeowner will sign the Project Documents and submit Downpayment.\nThe Downpayment will typically be the first payment the insurance company sends. This payment is called Actual Cash Value (ACV)\nYou receive $1,000 of the job at Downpayment.\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bInstall and Final Payment\nThe install will typically be scheduled in 4 – 6 weeks from the time that the Homeowner submits Downpayment\nAfter the install is complete, we will schedule a Quality Check and Wrap Up with the homeowner. \nThey will sign the Certificate of Completion here and we will submit this to the insurance company\nThe insurance company will then release the remaining funds.  They call this payment Depreciation.\nThe Homeowner then submits Final Payment.  This payment is a combination of the Depreciation plus their insurance deductible.\nOnce they submit Final Payment, you will receive the remaining 16% of the job.\nThe first 6 weeks, you get 16% of all completed jobs. After that, you have to qualify to get the max of 16%.\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bCommission %’s and Bonuses\nInsurance Sales\n$1000 paid on Downpayment\nTownhomes do not count as a sign/up sale unless:\nHas aluminum siding\nA minimum of 15sqs\nMarch - October\n10+ Sign ups:  16%\n8 - 9 Sign ups: 10%\nLess than 8 Sign ups: 6%\nNovember and February\n8+ Sign Ups:  16%\nLess than 8 Sign ups: 6%\nDecember and January\n4+ Sign ups:  16%\nLess than 4 Sign ups: 6%\nRetail\nNothing paid on Downpayment\nSolar: 2%\nOther than Solar: 2%\n15 Sign Ups or $200k in Revenue:  $2k\n20 Sign Ups or $250k in Revenue: $4k\n25 Sign Ups or $300k in Revenue:  $6k\n30 Sign Ups or $350k in Revenue: $10k\n35 Sign Ups or $400k in Revenue: $12k\n40 Sign Ups or $450k in Revenue: $16k\nPresident’s Club\n$2mil Annual Sales -or-\n$750k in 3 consecutive months in revenue\nThere will also be monthly incentives to earn additional bonuses, items (watches, golf clubs, etc), and events.\nAll bonuses and incentives are paid towards negative draw balance first\nRep has the option to receive bonus in first 90 days even if they have a negative draw balance\nLeave Behinds\nMailers\nRecap\nPlease have Generic Initial Pitch completely memorized\nPlease always be safe when conducting inspections\nSales Cycle: 9 – 16 weeks from sign up\nWork towards those bonuses!

How thorough of an inspection you  should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is most important. It doesn’t  matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you don’t have enough damage-photos for  the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim. \nFlashlight\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nKnock on the door \n“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. First I walked around the perimeter of the house  to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the roof.” Say this while going through house number and overview photos \nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story.  Think of us like lawyers and this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof approved.”\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage\nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is circular  in nature.   Even if this  damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these hail divots fill with water, freeze….,  when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance company is responsible and your policy covers this type of damage.” \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. \n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nNow show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts\n“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be what’s protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your roof, it knocks out these granules which reduces the lifespan of your roof.”\nPut phone away\n“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the area”.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when your insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all the damage that I  just showed you.” \n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go get iPad \nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10  Minutes”?\nOnce you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system. Then we can let your insurance company know about the damage”. \nGather information from the homeowner:\nFull name\nAddress\nPhone Number  \nE-mail\nInsurance Company\n“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”! \nAfter you have collected all the information:\nAsk if they have the app or if they have the login to the website. \nIf not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO.  As you are writing or typing the information for the HO to use on the call, explain each part to them.\nAs much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call \nReference Claim Filing Information Sheet\nMove on to Contingency & Claim Authorization\nPost-Inspection Pitch:\u000bAdditional lines if wind damage is present\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage and  anything I have slashed means its wind damage.”\nAfter you go through the lines explaining the hail damage, say:\n“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have (both,) shingles that are creased from the wind lifting them up (and shingles that have completely been blown off.”)\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles\nPost Inspection Pitch\nBreak into groups\nRead through Post Inspection Pitch with Hail Damage a few times\nWHEN IN DOUBT, SIGN IT UP. Not every roof is going to look like it was destroyed by 2 inch hail.  But, we still find a lot of success here.\nInspection and Post-Inspection Quiz\nWhat are the first pictures you take when you are on the roof?\nYou should ask if they have the insurance company’s app or website login first – True or False?\nWe should be mainly focusing on Wind Only claims – Ture or False?\nWhat symbol do we use to mark hail damage?\nWhat symbol is used to mark wind damage?\nWhat are 2 methods you can use to see hail damage to metals better?\nYou should take all photos of hail damage first (so that they are grouped,) and then all photos of wind damage after – True or False?\nClaim Filing Information Sheet\nClaim Filing Information Sheet\nCalling the Insurance Company\nWe will each practice calling the Insurance Company to file the claim\nI will demonstrate a few examples\nConnect with your trainers on how to assist your clients with filing this claim\nPutting the script together\nGo through Initial Pitch without script\nGo straight to Inspection and Post-Inspection pitch while reading script\nRecap\nFamiliarize yourself with Storm Damage\nMemorize the order of the Inspection\nHave Initial Pitch (non-storm environment) and (Hail Only) Post-Inspection Pitch memorized\nFamiliarize yourself with Claim Filing Information Sheet\nAlways ask Homeowner if they have the website login or app to file the claim first\nPlease be in and ready to start tomorrow morning at 1000am\nRoof-ER Sales Training\nWelcome:\nShilongo Shilongo\nVladimir Mosendz\nGiancarlo Moran\nBenjamin Salgado\nInitial Pitch and Post-Inspection Pitch\nBreak into groups\nReview memorized scripts (Initial Pitch and Post Inspection Pitch)\nSales App (Only on your iPad)\nContingency and Claim Authorization\nGoogle Drive\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\nThis is where you really go for the close\nAfter filing the claim: “Okay, perfect! Like they said, an adjuster will be reaching out to you in the next 24 to 48 hours to schedule the inspection. The absolute most important part of this process is that I am at this inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. They are trying to mitigate their losses after storms. I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake.”\nTurn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see.\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\n“This basic/simple agreement backs you as the homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost will be your deductible if we get you fully approved. If it is a partial approval or denial, first we will fight and jump through the necessary hoops to turn that into a full approval; but if we are not able to get you fully approved, this contract is null and void and you do not owe us a penny.\n“What’s in it for us, is we just want to get to do the work. This agreement commits you to using us if we hold up our end of the bargain and achieve a full-approval.”\nYou sign\nThey sign\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\n“This next form is our Claim Authorization form.  Very simple, it allows us to communicate with your insurance company.  I’ll be here for the inspection and  we will also communicate with them through email and phone calls so you don’t have to be a middle-man.  Of course, I’ll always keep you looped in with our communication by CCing you in all emails and updating you on any conversations we have.”\nThey sign\nPress Submit enter password “roofer” if it asks.\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\n“Alright, we are all set!

My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that specializes in helping homeowners get their roof replaced, paid for by their insurance!”  \nGeneric:\n“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Central Virginia/Philadelphia/Maryland over the past few months that have done a lot of damage! \n“We’re already working with your neighbors. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof  replaced.”\nInitial Pitch\n“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do,  I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nPause here – Wait for them to respond/agree.\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.\nGo in for a handshake. “What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am (your name).  Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”\n“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I will give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”\nWithout any hesitation, move into inspection.

This payment is called Actual Cash Value (ACV)\nYou receive $1,000 of the job at Downpayment.\nThe Sales Cycle:\u000bInstall and Final Payment\nThe install will typically be scheduled in 4 – 6 weeks from the time that the Homeowner submits Downpayment\nAfter the install is complete, we will schedule a Quality Check and Wrap Up with the homeowner. \nThey will sign the Certificate of Completion here and we will submit this to the insurance company\nThe insurance company will then release the remaining funds.  They call this payment Depreciation.\nThe Homeowner then submits Final Payment.  This payment is a combination of the Depreciation plus their insurance deductible.\nOnce they submit Final Payment, you will receive the remaining 16% of the job.\nThe first 6 weeks, you get 16% of all completed jobs.

How thorough of an inspection you  should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is most important. It doesn’t  matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you don’t have enough damage-photos for  the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim. \nFlashlight\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nKnock on the door \n“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. First I walked around the perimeter of the house  to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the roof.” Say this while going through house number and overview photos \nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story.  Think of us like lawyers and this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof approved.”\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage\nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is circular  in nature.   Even if this  damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these hail divots fill with water, freeze….,  when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance company is responsible and your policy covers this type of damage.” \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. \n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nNow show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts\n“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be what’s protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your roof, it knocks out these granules which reduces the lifespan of your roof.”\nPut phone away\n“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the area”.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when your insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all the damage that I  just showed you.” \n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go get iPad \nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10  Minutes”?\nOnce you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system. Then we can let your insurance company know about the damage”. \nGather information from the homeowner:\nFull name\nAddress\nPhone Number  \nE-mail\nInsurance Company\n“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”! \nAfter you have collected all the information:\nAsk if they have the app or if they have the login to the website. \nIf not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO.  As you are writing or typing the information for the HO to use on the call, explain each part to them.\nAs much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call \nReference Claim Filing Information Sheet\nMove on to Contingency & Claim Authorization\nPost-Inspection Pitch:\u000bAdditional lines if wind damage is present\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage and  anything I have slashed means its wind damage.”\nAfter you go through the lines explaining the hail damage, say:\n“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have (both,) shingles that are creased from the wind lifting them up (and shingles that have completely been blown off.”)\nShow the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles\nPost Inspection Pitch\nBreak into groups\nRead through Post Inspection Pitch with Hail Damage a few times\nWHEN IN DOUBT, SIGN IT UP. Not every roof is going to look like it was destroyed by 4 inch hail.  But, we still find a lot of success here.\nInspection and Post-Inspection Quiz\nWhat are the first pictures you take when you are on the roof?\nYou should ask if they have the insurance company’s app or website login first – True or False?\nWe should be mainly focusing on Wind Only claims – Ture or False?\nWhat symbol do we use to mark hail damage?\nWhat symbol is used to mark wind damage?\nWhat are 2 methods you can use to see hail damage to metals better?\nYou should take all photos of hail damage first (so that they are grouped,) and then all photos of wind damage after – True or False?\nClaim Filing Information Sheet\nClaim Filing Information Sheet\nCalling the Insurance Company\nExamples\nI will demonstrate a few examples\nConnect with your trainers on how to assist your clients with filing this claim\nPutting the script together\nGo through Initial Pitch without script\nGo straight to Inspection and Post-Inspection pitch while reading script\nRecap\nFamiliarize yourself with Storm Damage\nMemorize the order of the Inspection\nHave Initial Pitch (non-storm environment) and (Hail Only) Post-Inspection Pitch memorized\nFamiliarize yourself with Claim Filing Information Sheet\nAlways ask Homeowner if they have the website login or app to file the claim first\nPlease be in and ready to start tomorrow morning at 1000am\nRoof-ER Sales Training\nWelcome:\nInitial Pitch and Post-Inspection Pitch\nReview together\nSales App (Only on your iPad)\nContingency and Claim Authorization\nGoogle Drive\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\nThis is where you really go for the close\nAfter filing the claim: “Okay, perfect! Like they said, an adjuster will be reaching out to you in the next 24 to 48 hours to schedule the inspection. The absolute most important part of this process is that I am at this inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. They are trying to mitigate their losses after storms. I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake.”\nTurn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see.\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\n“This basic/simple agreement backs you as the homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost will be your deductible if we get you fully approved. If it is a partial approval or denial, first we will fight and jump through the necessary hoops to turn that into a full approval; but if we are not able to get you fully approved, this contract is null and void and you do not owe us a penny.\n“What’s in it for us, is we just want to get to do the work. This agreement commits you to using us if we hold up our end of the bargain and achieve a full-approval.”\nYou sign\nThey sign\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\n“This next form is our Claim Authorization form.  Very simple, it allows us to communicate with your insurance company.  I’ll be here for the inspection and  we will also communicate with them through email and phone calls so you don’t have to be a middle-man.  Of course, I’ll always keep you looped in with our communication by CCing you in all emails and updating you on any conversations we have.”\nThey sign\nPress Submit enter password “roofer” if it asks.\nContingency & Claim Authorization Script\n“Alright, we are all set!

If you do,  I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”\nPause here – Wait for them to respond/agree.\nOnce they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright!

First I walked around the perimeter of the house  to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the roof.” Say this while going through house number and overview photos \nStart showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals\n“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story.  Think of us like lawyers and this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof approved.”\nContinue to slide through collateral damage photos\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage\nRemain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following\n“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is circular  in nature.   Even if this  damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these hail divots fill with water, freeze….,  when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance company is responsible and your policy covers this type of damage.” \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. \n“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  \nStart slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\nNow show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts\n“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be what’s protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your roof, it knocks out these granules which reduces the lifespan of your roof.”\nPut phone away\n“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the area”.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when your insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all the damage that I  just showed you.” \n“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go get iPad \nAs you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10  Minutes”?\nOnce you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled.\nPost-Inspection Pitch\n“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system.
