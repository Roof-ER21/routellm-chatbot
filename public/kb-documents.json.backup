    "content": "Roof-ER Top 10 Quick Facts Cheat Sheet\n1. Failed Repair = Full Replacement:\nIf shingles crack/break during manipulation (brittle test), repairs are not possible.\nUse Repair Attempt Template.\n2. Discontinued Shingles:\nUse GAF's discontinued list or iTel to prove repairs cannot be blended.\nMixing old/new is not acceptable.\n3. Slope Rule (Virginia):\nAsphalt shingles only allowed on slopes 2/12 or greater.\nFlatter slopes must use flat roof system.\n4. Siding Replacement (Maryland):\nPer code, housewrap & barrier required.\nReplacement of siding is often unavoidable due to code + mismatch issues.\n5. Flashing:\nCode requires replacing damaged/rusted flashings.\nInsurance cannot demand reuse.\n6. Storm Damage = Replacement:\nGAF states latent hail/wind damage (granule loss, cracks, mat exposure)\nleads to roof failure.\nPatch repairs not reliable.\n7. Partial Approvals:\nGAF slope replacement guidelines show disturbing adjacent slopes\nrequires full replacement of adjoining sections.\n8. Insurance Weather Data:\nAlways ask which source they used.\nCounter with iTel or HailTrace reports.\n9. Mismatch (Maryland):\nBulletin 18-23 requires insurers to address shade/texture mismatch.\nElsewhere, argue loss of value + discontinued product.\n10. Escalation Path:\n(1) Template fi (2) Code/Manufacturer Support fi (3) Homeowner Complaint\nfi (4) Arbitration/Appraisal if needed.\nFor Roof-ER field reps ‚Äì Use this sheet during claims and adjuster meetings.",

Non-Storm Damage\nWelcome to Roof-ER!\nMeet the Owner:\nMy name is Oliver Brown. I founded this company in 2019, not because I have a passion for roofing or because I was born into a family of contractors, but because I saw an opportunity. An opportunity to change the reputation of roofing companies and contractors as a whole. This is an industry that is known for lack of communication, poor workmanship, used car sales techniques and straight up deceit by companies who still write up quotes with a pen and paper. With a little bit of modern thinking, integrity and hard work we‚Äôve been able to build a strong brand and reputation in a relatively short amount of time. From $2.5m in year one, as a one man sales team to $20m in 2023, we are one of the fastest growing roofing companies in the DMV. That growth has only been possible by attracting like minded people who are looking to change their lives and those around them‚Ä¶ And we are just getting started! \nWe have ambitions of growing up and down the east coast and eventually becoming a national brand. To accomplish this we need to continue to add and develop hungry, competitive team members who are dedicated to the big picture but disciplined to execute on a day to day basis. \nWelcome to your new career!\nMy name is Reese Samala, Director of Sales, here at Roof-ER! I will be spending your first week here with you.  I am excited to see what you accomplish here with us.\nA quick introduction of who I am:\nI am a medically retired Infantryman",

You will also be able to see if your Hover is still processing and not ready for download yet.\nYou will do this through your internet browser; this can be done on a computer, ipad, or on your phone.  Go to the website: Hover.to\nOnce you go there, search your customer‚Äôs Job ID to find your customer. See the screenshot below.  The Job ID is 6902\nIf you manually created the hover (which you should not be doing) you will have to just search for the customer‚Äôs hover that you manually created.\nOnce you open the file, you will click ‚Äúexport‚Äù.

    "content": "Arbitration Information\nBinding Arbitration\nLegally enforceable like a court decision.\nBoth parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator‚Äôs decision as final.\nNo appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).\nOnce the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply ‚Äî often enforced in court if needed.\nExample: An insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via\nbinding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that\namount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\nNon-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator‚Äôs decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\nExample: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and\ndecides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\nImportant for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it ‚Äî\nit can‚Äôt be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.\nComplaint Forms\nHave HO use these websites to submit a complaint\nAllstate:\nNationwide:\nUnder ‚ÄúWhat is your Email About‚Äù Select ‚ÄúGeneral Inquiries‚Äù\nUnder ‚ÄúWhat is the Subject of your Email‚Äù Select ‚ÄúFeedback & Complaints‚Äù\nState Farm:\nSelect ‚ÄúOther‚Äù on drop down menu, and then click the link that says ‚Äúthis form‚Äù\nErie:\nTravelers:\nIf you/HO already sent email(s) to\nUse this link to file a complaint:\nSelect ‚ÄúGive complaint or Share a concern‚Äù on the first drop down menu\nThen select ‚ÄúYour Experience‚Äù on the second drop down menu\nUnder the ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù drop down menu, HO should select ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù\n(You shouldn‚Äôt fill this form out often, but if you d",

    "content": "Post Adjuster Meeting Script\nThis is the conversation you will have with the HO after an adjuster meeting\nIf moving to Estimate Pending:\n‚ÄúGreat! The Adjuster/Ladder Assist identified all the same damage as me.  You will be receiving an email from us shortly saying that you‚Äôve been fully approved.  Within a few days you should receive the itemized estimate from the Insurance Company.  Once you receive that, you can forward that to me. This is going to include every line item that the insurance company believes is needed to make you whole again. To you this is going to look like gibberish. But, don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for. If for some weird reason the desk adjuster does not write it for a full approval after this inspection, I will take the steps necessary to get it turned around! Any questions on that, sir/ma‚Äôam?‚Äù\nAnswer any questions\n‚ÄúWhen the insurance company generates their estimate, it will also typically trigger the release of the first payment. The insurance company refers to this payment as the ACV. Which stands for Actual Cash Value. That amount will be used as your down payment.  The remaining funds are held by the insurance company until we complete the work. They refer to these remaining funds as Depreciation. Which is not ‚Äúdepreciation‚Äù as most would think about it, it‚Äôs just their way of holding on to some of the funds to make sure the work gets done.\n‚ÄúAt the same time our office will be reviewing your entire project along with my photos and the insurance estimate. As I‚Äôve mentioned, insurance companies are always trying to save money.  We usually find specific line items that are missing. Most commonly, code items like IWS and Drip Edge. We will supplement for all the items needed to complete your project to code and our manufacturer‚Äôs specifications. Don‚Äôt worry, like we have agreed to from the beginning, we guarantee you that you would not have to cover any of these costs even if the insurance company were to deny our supplement. [Which d",

Due to the brittleness of the roof in general, during the repair the two rows of shingles above the one we were attempting to replace sustained unavoidable mechanical creasing. These photos clearly demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably do further damage to surrounding shingles.\n1. These can be seen in the updated photo report under the \"Brittle Test\" section, and best shown in Photos:(___)\nOR\n2.

    "content": "What is a homeowners deductible?\n- A homeowners insurance deductible is the amount a homeowner\nmust pay out of pocket before their insurance coverage applies.\nWhen a claim is approved, the insurance company will cover the\ntotal damage cost minus the deductible amount.\n- The terminology can be confusing, it may be helpful to think of it as\na copay, like when you go to the doctor.\n- It is important to note that if a deductible is not paid, there can be\nlegal consequences and any deprecation and/or PWI will be\nforfeited.\nTo whom is the deductible paid to?\n- You don‚Äôt pay your deductible directly to the insurance company\nlike a bill. Instead, it‚Äôs deducted from your claim payout. You'll\ncover the remaining amount‚Äîyour deductible‚Äîwhen paying the\ncontractor or company repairing the damage.\nPer-Claim Basis:\n- It is important to note that homeowners insurance deductibles\ndiFer from health insurance deductibles in that they are paid on a\nper-claim basis (per event), whereas a health insurance deductible\nhas a maximum annual out of pocket.\nLet‚Äôs Run Two Examples:\n- In the first example, let‚Äôs say your deductible is $2,000 and you file\na claim for storm damage to your roof. The insurance company\nthen approves the work for $20,000. The insurance writes the\nestimate, subtracts the deductible, and pays out $18,000 while the\nremaining $2,000 (your deductible) is paid to the contractor.\n- Now let‚Äôs suppose your deductible is $1,000, and you file a claim\nfor storm damage to your gutters. The insurance company\napproves the claim and estimates the repair cost at $900. Since the\nrepair cost is less than your deductible, you‚Äôll be responsible for\ncovering the full amount.\nHere‚Äôs what insurance companies and reporting agencies say:\n‚Ä¢ Allstate\n‚Ä¢ Travelers\n‚Ä¢ Rocket Mortgage\n‚Ä¢ USAA\n‚Ä¢ State Farm\n‚Ä¢ Forbes\n‚Ä¢ Policygenius\nInsurance Claim Example (USAA):",

    "content": "Arbitration Information\n Binding Arbitration\nLegally enforceable like a court decision.\nBoth parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator‚Äôs decision as final.\nNo appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).\nOnce the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply ‚Äî often enforced in court if needed.\n Example:\nAn insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via binding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that amount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\n Non-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator‚Äôs decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\n Example:\nThe arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and decides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\n Important for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it ‚Äî it can‚Äôt be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.",

The Bulletin noted that replacement of\ndamaged siding with new siding may result in a mismatch between existing siding and newly\ninstalled siding due to color shade, texture or dimension. Bulletin No. 97-1 advised that if a\nmismatch occurs, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other less visible\nareas of the house to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged\nsiding on one or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or a monetary allowance to\nreflect diminution in value of the house caused by mismatch. Bulletin No. 97-1 also noted that\nthe law does not require a replacement cost policy to ensure in every instance the replacement of\nall siding, including undamaged siding, in order to eliminate or minimize mismatching. At the\nsame time, the MIA advised that insurers whose settlement practices failed to take into account\nmajor differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions would be subject to\nadministrative action ",

    "content": "Aluminum Siding Claims\nMIA BULLETIN NO. 97-1\nThe Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) has received numerous complaints\nfrom homeowners concerning the settlement practices of insurers of claims for damage to\naluminum siding from hail. These complaints allege practices by insurers of paying to\nreplace only those portions of siding that are physically damaged without regard to the\nmismatching between existing and new siding. Failure to adjust such claims in accordance\nwith policy provisions or the company‚Äôs own operations or settlement guidelines may result\nin a finding that the insurer is in violation of Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code. This\nBulletin reiterates long-standing MIA policy regarding the settlement of such claims.\nThe MIA interprets Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, in the following manner\nas to claims for aluminum siding damage under a covered peril made under a ‚Äúreplacement\ncost‚Äù homeowner‚Äôs policy. The replacement of damaged siding with new siding may result in\nmismatched siding between the existing siding and the newly replaced siding. In such cases\nof mismatching, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other areas of the\nhouse to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged siding on\none or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or an allowance to reflect\ndiminution in value of the house caused by the mismatch. While the MIA does not interpret a\nreplacement cost policy to require in every instance, replacement of all siding including\nundamaged siding in order to minimize mismatching, insurers whose settlement practices fail\nto take into account major differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions as\nprovided above may be subject to action under Section 230A.\nInsurers should inform their insureds of any appraisal rights under the policy where\nthere is disagreement on the amount of a covered loss.

    "content": "Documentation & Templates (Q101‚ÄìQ125)\nQ101: Question: \nWhen should the Repair Attempt Template be used?\nShort Answer (with source):\nUse when a repair was attempted and shingles cracked, tore, or failed ‚Äî proving irreparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe Repair Attempt Template should be used anytime a repair test is performed and the shingles crack, tear, or break when manipulated. This template documents the attempt and outcome, proving to insurance that repairs are not feasible. It provides a professional, standardized way to present irreparability .\nQ102: Adjuster says: \n‚ÄúRepair attempt wasn‚Äôt necessary.‚Äù\nShort Answer (with source):\nRepair attempts are industry standard to determine reparability .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou‚Äôve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair attempts are an industry-accepted method to test whether shingles are repairable. Our documented attempt caused additional damage, confirming brittleness and irreparability. This supports the need for full replacement .\nQ103: Homeowner asks: \n‚ÄúWhy did you damage my roof during testing?‚Äù\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe brittle test is standard and proves shingles can‚Äôt be repaired .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nThe brittle test may look like damage, but it‚Äôs an industry-accepted method to confirm whether shingles are repairable. By carefully attempting to lift and reseal shingles, we document whether they fracture. If they do, as in this case, it proves irreparability and strengthens your claim for full replacement .\nQ104: Carrier says: \n‚ÄúYour repair attempt caused the damage.‚Äù\nShort Answer (with source):\nDamage during repair attempt proves brittleness, not contractor error .\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYou‚Äôve stated our repair attempt caused the damage. In reality, the cracking during the attempt is the proof of brittleness and irreparability. The Repair Attempt Template documents this result. Repairs would ",

This requires full replacement .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nPlease see the attached photo report documenting storm-related damage on multiple slopes. The photos clearly show creased and missing shingles, which are consistent with functional wind damage and cannot be repaired without causing further harm. Per standard industry practice, this constitutes irreparability, and a full replacement is required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. We respectfully request that your estimate be revised accordingly .\nQ2: Adjuster says: \n‚ÄúHail is cosmetic and doesn‚Äôt affect function.‚Äù\nShort Answer (with source):\nHail damage is not cosmetic ‚Äî it causes granule loss, mat fractures, and sealant bond failures, per GAF .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour denial states that hail damage is cosmetic only. However, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, hail impact causes functional issues such as granule loss, cracks in the asphalt mat, and compromised sealant bonds. These defects accelerate roof deterioration and shorten lifespan, making the roof irreparable. For these reasons, this damage cannot be dismissed as cosmetic. Please update your estimate to reflect full roof replacement .\nQ3: Carrier says: \n‚ÄúShingles can be patched.‚Äù\nShort Answer (with source):\nThe iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued; patching would cause mismatches and fail manufacturer standards .\nDetailed Answer (Email Draft):\nTo whom it may concern,\nYour position that the roof can be patched is not consistent with the findings of the attached iTel report, which confirms that the installed shingles are discontinued. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, no comparable replacements exist. Mixing discontinued shing",
