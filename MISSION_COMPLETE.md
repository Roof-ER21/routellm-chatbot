## 🐛 Bug Fixes Completed

### Bug #1: Photo Search Returning 0 Photos
**Fixed in:** `lib/photo-index.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Old code only checked for exact "drip edge" substring
'drip edge': ['drip edge', 'drip', 'edge metal']
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Now handles compound labels and fallback patterns
'drip/iws/layers': ['drip edge', 'ice and water shield', 'layers', 'drip', 'iws'],
'drip': ['drip edge', 'drip'],

// Fallback pattern:
if (normalized.includes('drip')) terms.push('drip edge', 'drip');
```

**Test Result:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/agnes-chat \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"show me drip edge photos"}],"characterId":"none"}'

Response: ✅ Returns 2 photos instead of 0
```

---

### Bug #2: Back Button Logging Out Users
**Fixed in:** `app/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Line 107 - Too restrictive check
if (currentUser && isRemembered()) {
  setIsAuthenticated(true)
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Line 109 - Session persists during browser session
if (currentUser) {
  setIsAuthenticated(true)

  // Only load conversation if Remember Me enabled
  if (isRemembered()) {
    // ... load conversation ...
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Users stay logged in when navigating Training → Home
- ✅ "Remember Me" still controls conversation persistence
- ✅ No more unexpected logouts

## 🎓 What Was Learned

### Key Insights
1. **Photo Labeling Matters**
   - Compound labels need special handling
   - Forward slashes create matching challenges
   - Fallback patterns are essential

2. **Session Management**
   - Separate "logged in" from "remembered"
   - Browser session vs persistent session
   - Navigation should preserve state

3. **Deployment Completeness**
   - All dependencies must be committed
   - Missing components break production builds
   - Test locally before pushing

### Technical Patterns Applied
- **Modular component architecture**
- **AI failover chains**
- **Citation injection system**
- **Photo search with relevance**
- **Session state management**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### If Railway Build Fails
1. Check Railway logs for specific error
2. Verify all files are committed: `git status`
3. Test build locally: `npm run build`
4. Check for missing dependencies: `npm install`

### If Photos Don't Appear
1. Check browser console for 404 errors
2. Verify `/kb-images/` path in public folder
3. Check `kb-images-manifest.json` is deployed
4. Test API: `curl /api/photos/search?q=drip+edge`

### If Session Logout Occurs
1. Check localStorage in DevTools
2. Verify `susan21_simple_auth` key exists
3. Check `currentUser` is not null
4. Test with "Remember Me" checked

### If Citations Missing
1. Check `kb-documents.json` is deployed
2. Verify API route: `curl /api/citations`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test citation extraction locally
