# Comprehensive Argument-to-Code Mapping

## Purpose
This document provides the CORRECT mapping between insurance claim arguments and their proper citations. Susan MUST follow this mapping to avoid citing codes incorrectly.

---

## CRITICAL RULE: WHEN TO USE BUILDING CODES VS OTHER CITATIONS

### ✅ USE Building Codes (IRC) When:
- Arguing that **IF** work is approved, it must meet current code requirements
- Discussing required materials/methods for new construction or replacement
- Explaining mandatory upgrades when work is performed

### ❌ DO NOT USE Building Codes For:
- Repairability arguments
- Discontinued product arguments
- Storm damage assessments
- Matching requirements (except MD Bulletin 18-23)

---

## ARGUMENT TYPE 1: REPAIRABILITY

### When to Use:
- Shingles are too brittle/old to repair
- Repair attempt failed (brittle test)
- Age and condition prevent manipulation

### CORRECT Citations:
- **GAF Storm Damage Guidelines** - "GAF recommends against repairing more than 2-3 shingles per plane"
- **Manufacturer Warranty** - "Repairs void manufacturer warranty"
- **Brittle Test Documentation** - Physical evidence of failed repair attempt
- **NO IRC CODE SHOULD BE CITED**

### Example Language:
> "Based on the brittle test we conducted [attach photos], the existing shingles cannot be repaired without causing additional damage. GAF guidelines recommend full replacement when shingles fail manipulation. This is a repairability issue, not a code violation."

### Success Rate: 92% (Virginia), 90% (Pennsylvania)

---

## ARGUMENT TYPE 2: DISCONTINUED SHINGLES

### When to Use:
- Shingles are no longer manufactured
- iTel report confirms discontinuation
- Metric vs English dimension mismatch

### CORRECT Citations:
- **iTel Report** - Laboratory confirmation of discontinued product
- **GAF/CertainTeed Discontinued Lists** - Official manufacturer lists
- **Dimensional Incompatibility** - Metric vs English exposure differences prevent blending
- **NO IRC CODE SHOULD BE CITED**

### Example Language:
> "Per the attached iTel report, the existing shingles are discontinued. The new metric-dimension shingles have a larger exposure size and cannot be mixed with the existing English-dimension shingles. The sealant strips would not align properly, violating manufacturer installation standards."

### Success Rate: 88% (all states)

---

## ARGUMENT TYPE 3: CODE COMPLIANCE (When Reroofing IS Approved)

### When to Use:
- Insurance has approved full or partial replacement
- Arguing that replacement must be done to current code
- Explaining mandatory upgrades

### CORRECT Citations:

#### **IRC R908.3 - Reroofing Requirements**
- **What it says**: When existing roof covering is removed, underlayment and ice & water shield must be brought to current code
- **When to use**: ONLY when reroofing is already approved, to argue scope must include code-compliant underlayment
- **Example**: "Per IRC R908.3, when the existing roof covering is removed for replacement, the underlayment and ice & water shield must meet current 2021 IRC standards."

#### **IRC R905.2.2 - Slope Requirements**
- **What it says**: Low-slope applications require two layers of underlayment
- **When to use**: Slopes below 4:12 requiring special treatment
- **Example**: "This roof has a 3:12 slope. Per IRC R905.2.2, low-slope applications require two layers of underlayment."

#### **IRC R905.1.2 - Ice Barrier**
- **What it says**: Ice barrier required in areas prone to ice damming
- **When to use**: Arguing for ice & water shield in climate zones with ice dam risk
- **Example**: "Virginia's 2021 IRC requires ice barrier installation per R905.1.2 when average daily temperature is ≤ 25°F."

#### **IRC R703.2/R703.4 - Siding/Flashing (Exterior Work)**
- **What it says**: Water-resistive barrier and flashing required behind exterior veneer
- **When to use**: Siding replacement arguments requiring housewrap
- **Example**: "Per IRC R703.2, a water-resistive barrier (housewrap) is required behind exterior siding when replacement work is performed."

### Success Rate: 90% (when used correctly - ONLY for approved work scope)

---

## ARGUMENT TYPE 4: MATCHING REQUIREMENTS

### MARYLAND ONLY - MIA Bulletin 18-23

#### When to Use:
- Maryland properties ONLY
- Visible mismatch in color, shade, texture, or dimension
- Discontinued products preventing aesthetic match

#### CORRECT Citation:
- **MIA Bulletin 18-23** (October 30, 2018)
- **What it says**: Settlement options include replacement of damaged and undamaged siding/roofing on one or more sides, full replacement, or monetary allowance for diminution in value
- **Key provision**: "Insurers whose settlement practices fail to take into account major differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions may be subject to administrative action"

#### Example Language:
> "Under Maryland MIA Bulletin 18-23, insurance companies must address mismatches in color shade, texture, or dimension when replacing damaged materials. Since the product is discontinued and will create a visible mismatch, the insurer must either replace all affected elevations or provide a monetary allowance for diminution in value."

#### Success Rate: 93% (Maryland only)

### VIRGINIA & PENNSYLVANIA - NO MATCHING REQUIREMENT

#### Critical Rule:
- **Virginia and Pennsylvania DO NOT have matching insurance requirements**
- Matching ONLY applies if policy has matching endorsement
- **NEVER argue "matching required by law" in VA or PA**

#### Use These Arguments Instead:
1. **Repairability** (brittle test, age/condition)
2. **Differing dimensions** (prevents proper installation)
3. **Missed storm damage** (unapproved areas need expansion)
4. **Code compliance** (IF work approved, must meet R908.3)

---

## ARGUMENT TYPE 5: STORM DAMAGE ASSESSMENT

### When to Use:
- Hail damage, wind damage, or latent storm damage
- Arguing for full replacement vs repair

### CORRECT Citations:
- **GAF Storm Damage Recommendations** - Technical bulletin on identifying storm damage
- **HAAG Certification Standards** - Industry-standard damage assessment
- **Photo documentation** - Visual evidence of damage
- **NO IRC CODE SHOULD BE CITED**

### Example Language:
> "Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, the presence of granule loss, exposed mat, and cracked shingles across multiple planes indicates storm damage requiring full replacement. Patch repairs are not reliable when multiple shingles are compromised."

### Success Rate: 91% (all states)

---

## ARGUMENT TYPE 6: MISSED DAMAGE / SCOPE EXPANSION

### When to Use:
- Additional damage found after initial approval
- Unapproved slopes/areas showing similar damage

### CORRECT Citations:
- **Photo Report** - Documentation of additional damage
- **Consistency argument** - "Damage pattern matches approved areas"
- **NO IRC CODE SHOULD BE CITED**

### Example Language:
> "Our photo report [attached] shows storm damage on the north and west slopes consistent with the east slope damage already approved. We request scope revision to include all affected areas."

### Success Rate: 87% (all states)

---

## STATE-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

### VIRGINIA
**Primary Arguments:**
1. Repairability (brittle test)
2. Differing dimensions
3. Code compliance (R908.3) when work approved
4. Missed storm damage

**NEVER Use:** Matching requirements (no matching law)

### MARYLAND
**Primary Arguments:**
1. MIA Bulletin 18-23 (matching)
2. Aesthetic mismatch with discontinued products
3. Code compliance (R908.3) when work approved
4. Repairability as secondary

**Always Use:** MIA Bulletin 18-23 for matching arguments

### PENNSYLVANIA
**Primary Arguments:**
1. Repairability (brittle test)
2. Differing dimensions
3. Code compliance (R908.3) when work approved
4. Missed storm damage

**NEVER Use:** Matching requirements (no matching law)

## COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

### ❌ ERROR: Citing IRC R908.3 for repairability
**Problem:** R908.3 is about reroofing code requirements, not repairability
**Correct:** Use GAF guidelines and brittle test for repairability

### ❌ ERROR: Citing IRC codes for discontinued shingles
**Problem:** IRC doesn't address product availability
**Correct:** Use iTel report and manufacturer lists

### ❌ ERROR: Arguing "matching required" in Virginia or Pennsylvania
**Problem:** These states have no matching insurance requirements
**Correct:** Argue repairability, differing dimensions, or code compliance

### ❌ ERROR: Using building codes for storm damage assessment
**Problem:** IRC doesn't define storm damage criteria
**Correct:** Use GAF Storm Damage Guidelines and photo documentation
