Inspection/Adjuster Meeting Outcomes
Approval process for a roof
• Find good damage to metals and shingles
• Find good damage to discontinued shingles
• Find good soft metal damage and failed brittle test on all disconnected slopes (shingle damage
helpful as well)
• If passes brittle test, but enough damage to all slopes that adjuster disagreed with, clearly
document all damages
Approval process for siding
• Find good damage on all elevations
• Take photos of damage on unapproved sides
• Get iTel report
If it suggests a match, get sample and take side-by-side photo to show “match”
o
Outcomes
• Decision Pending: if you don’t know what’s going to happen or it needs to be reviewed by desk
adjuster
• Reinspection: if they approved very little, there is enough damage/good insurance, and
homeowner is on board
• Partial supplement: well-documented damage w/ reasonable insurance company (may be better
off with a reinspection now)
• Public Adjuster: if not enough damage to all sides of siding or all roof slopes, difficult insurance
company/adjuster, or rep is unable to get proper documentation
• Retail: homeowner does not want reinspection, insurance denies a reinspection, or final approval
results in a partial

Adjuster Meeting Outcomes
General Notes
• The adjuster is always going to go back to the homeowner before they leave (if they are home),
explain to them what they found and the next steps.
• Always join the adjuster for this conversation to make sure everything is being accurately relayed
to the homeowner
• If you are not there, it is an opportunity for the adjuster to blame you if they aren’t approving the
claim
• It is also a great opportunity to back up the adjuster on anything they are trying to explain to the
homeowner
• Adjusters really appreciate this
• Have to remember that these guys aren’t sales people and may not be the best at handling
homeowners/ explaining the process.
Approved
• Reminders

“We will supplement their estimate and add on specific line items that they should be

Christian Ballester USAA/Progressive/Liberty Adjuster Y Y Always looking to buy. Appreciates when the roof/siding/exterior is already marked up. Get Hover ESX file so he can write estimate easily
Badou Hadidane USAA Adjuster N N Terrible. Try to get HO to call to get this claim reassigned instead. Spends 10 minutes on the roof and gets off not looking to buy. Most of the time will deny it and you will need to get the reinspection. Will only buy if there's lots of signs. Wants Hover report, but it wont change his decision if you give it to him or not. Might be a waste of time and money giving him the Hover report. Do not supplement his approvals
Vicki Henry Homesite (Afics) Adjuster Y Y Very easy to work with. Will use a ladder assist but buys most of the time if the roof is marked up well and damage makes sense. Get Hover ESX for her
Matt Schneider Travelers Adjuster N Y Nice guy and willing to buy. Will use a ladder assist but very reasonable
Jared Hutto USAA Adjuster Y Y Marks hail and claims he's buying but desk adjusters can deny his reports. Make sure you take pictures of all his markings after the meeting
Garrett miller USAA Inspector Y Y Will take photos of anything you mark. Super friendly. Remind him to write number of hail and wind hits
Ashley USAA Inspecter Y Has someone else go on the roof. Take photos of everything. She's impartial and sends photos to desk adjuster.

    content: `Arbitration Information
 Binding Arbitration
Legally enforceable like a court decision.
Both parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final.
No appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).
Once the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply — often enforced in court if needed.
 Example:
An insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via binding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that amount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.
 Non-Binding Arbitration
The arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.
Either party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.
Often used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.
 Example:
The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and decides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.
 Important for Insurance Claims:
Binding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.
Most policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.
Virginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it — it can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.`,

After the claim: “Okay, perfect! Like they said, an adjuster will be reaching out to you in the next 24 to 48 hours to schedule the inspection. The absolute most important part of this process is that I am at this inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. They are trying to mitigate their losses after storms. I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake. 
Turn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see. 
“This basic/simple agreement backs you as the homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost will be your deductible if we get you fully approved. If it is a partial approval or denial, first we will fight and jump through the necessary hoops to turn that into a full approval; but if we are not able to get you fully approved, this contract is null and void and you do not owe us a penny.”

Our Mission:
At Roof-ER, our mission is to hold a fiduciary responsibility to our customers -
plain and simple. In an industry known for poor workmanship, lack of
communication, and at times, outright deceit; we seek to restore the name of
exterior remodeling contractors nationwide. By committing to our core values
of Integrity, Quality, and Simplicity, we promise to deliver an experience every
homeowner wants when remodeling their home: a simple and straightforward
quality installation for a fair and honest price.
Our Core Values:
Integrity: At Roof-ER, we set the standard for Integrity in an industry that has
lost credibility among many consumers. We do not only set the standard of
integrity with our clients, but it starts with being honest to ourselves. We have
the courage to truly see ourselves, recognize where we can grow, and
implement changes to meet the demands of reality.
Quality: We guarantee the highest Quality in our products and services. Our
confidence in our craft propels us into the elite 2% of all roofing companies in
the entire nation. Quality starts with the moment a client interacts with one of
our representatives at the door. The Quality demonstrated in every aspect of
what we do continues to make Roof-ER the gold standard of this industry.
Simplicity: We strive to deliver an overwhelmingly positive experience for
everyone who interacts with Roof-ER. By embracing the complexities of our
industry, we provide exceptional results to our clients. Our clients value the
Simplicity of partnering with us – we guarantee a seamless process from
start to finish ensuring satisfaction with the final outcome.
Your Commitment:
1. I will conduct myself in alignment with the Mission and Core Values.
2. I will dedicate myself to Roof-ER’s successful sales process.
3. I will always show an exceptional level of integrity when interacting with
clients, co-workers, and (especially) myself.
4. I will listen to and grow from receiving cons`,

To whom it may concern,
Please see the attached video link and photo report of the attempted repair for the claim number [#_____]. As can be clearly seen in the video and pictures, the homeowner's roof sustained additional damage during the attempted repairs. This confirms a failed brittle test for the shingles, indicating irreparability.
With this fact established, your estimate as it currently stands would not actually fix the damages, but would in fact further compromise the integrity of the roof as a whole. Therefore I have gone ahead and attached an estimate below that accurately reflects the full scope of work necessary to make our mutual client whole again. 
YouTube Link:  
↓[USE THIS PARAGRAPH ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES]↓
I also ask that you take note of the before and after pictures of the attempted repair. Due to the brittleness of the roof in general, during the repair the two rows of shingles above the one we were attempting to replace sustained unavoidable mechanical creasing. These photos clearly demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably do further damage to surrounding shingles.
1. These can be seen in the updated photo report under the "Brittle Test" section, and best shown in Photos:(___)
OR
2. Please find these photos attached below.
I kindly ask that you review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly, so we can begin to move forward with the necessary full [Roof AND/OR Siding] replacement`,

Q401: Carrier says: 
“Arbitration isn’t available.”
Short Answer (with source):
Arbitration is available per policy and state insurance law .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve denied arbitration. Per arbitration information, many policies include arbitration or appraisal as dispute resolution. State law requires carriers to honor this process if included .
Q402: Adjuster says: 
“Arbitration takes too long.”
Short Answer (with source):
Arbitration is faster than litigation .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve said arbitration takes too long. Per arbitration resources, arbitration is designed to be faster and less costly than court, resolving disputes efficiently .
Q403: Carrier says: 
“We don’t arbitrate claim disputes.”
Short Answer (with source):
If policy includes arbitration, carrier must comply .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve denied arbitration. If the policy includes arbitration or appraisal, carriers are contractually obligated to comply. Denial breaches policy obligations .
Q404: Homeowner asks: 
“What is arbitration?”

“Arbitration isn’t binding.”
Short Answer (with source):
Insurance arbitration decisions are binding .

“Hello sir/ma’am! It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. Congratulations, I am glad we were able to ensure that your insurance company fully approved your roof/siding/gutters/etc replacement!

“One of our Project Coordinators will be reaching out to you to schedule a Project Meeting to go over your full scope of work.
“Based on the estimate, your insurance company will be sending you [ACV AMOUNT] shortly.  This will be used as your down payment.  With that, we can start all of your work! When they send you that check, just hold on to it until your meeting with our Project Coordinator who will help with all the next steps.
“Our estimating team will also be sending in supplements to the insurance company based on items they may have missed. This includes Code Items such as IWS and Drip Edge. And don’t worry! Even if for some reason they do not approve these amounts, we will still do all the necessary work and never charge you for it.  As we talked about earlier, your only cost out of this will be your deductible once we finish all the work.
“Upon completion of the installation, we will review and inspect all of our work to ensure it is to your satisfaction.  Then we will send in a completion form once you sign off on the complete project.  That’s when the insurance company will release the remaining funds minus your deductible.  So your final payment will only be those funds plus your deductible.
“Any questions so far, sir/ma’am?”
Answer any questions
“Great! Again, I am glad that we were able to make this happen for you, now you get to experience the quality that Roof ER always delivers, at only the cost of your deductible after your whole project is complete!” Potentially mention additional work that they may want to add.

To whom it may concern:
This is [REP NAME] with Roof ER.  I am assisting [CUSTOMER’s NAME].  Attached is our Photo Report, Claim Authorization, and GAF Storm Damage Guidelines. 
GAF's guideline to not repair any more than 2 or 3 shingles.  A repair at the level that is in your current decision would cause significantly more damage to [CUSTOMER NAMES]’s roof, and would not be an effective solution to restore his property after the hail storm that impacted his house.
Please update your current estimate to take this into consideration.
We sincerely appreciate your time and assistance.

    content: `GAF Manufacturer Guidelines & Storm Standards (Q201–Q225)
Q201: Carrier says: 
“Shingle creases aren’t functional damage.”
Short Answer (with source):
GAF confirms creased shingles lose sealant and can’t be repaired .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve stated shingle creases are not functional damage. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, creasing causes the sealant strip to fail, reducing wind resistance and making repairs impossible. These shingles must be replaced .
Q202: Adjuster says: 
“Sealant strips can be resealed.”
Short Answer (with source):
Resealing isn’t manufacturer-approved; GAF requires replacement .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve proposed resealing shingles. Per GAF guidelines, resealing is not an approved repair. Once a sealant strip fails, replacement is required to maintain warranty and performance .
Q203: Carrier says: 
“Granule loss is cosmetic only.”
Short Answer (with source):
GAF confirms granule loss exposes asphalt mat, accelerating failure .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve dismissed granule loss as cosmetic. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granules protect shingles from UV and weather. Loss exposes the asphalt mat, accelerates aging, and voids warranty. Replacement is required .
Q204: Adjuster says: 
“Bruises don’t affect roof function.”
Short Answer (with source):
Bruising cracks asphalt mat, weakening waterproofing .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve dismissed hail bruises. Per GAF, hail bruising fractures the asphalt mat and loosens granules, weakening waterproofing. This constitutes functional damage requiring replacement .
Q205: Carrier says: 
“Missing shingles can be spot repaired.”
Short Answer (with source):
GAF requires full slope replacement if shingles are discontinued .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve said missing shingles can be spot repaired. If the shingles are disconti`,

After the Hover is approved, you will receive an email from Hover with the PDF.  Once you receive that, it means your Hover is ready (if it is roof and siding, it will take a little bit longer to have the siding added as well.)
Once the Hover is complete, you will be able to download your own ESX, XML, or PDF.  You will also be able to see if your Hover is still processing and not ready for download yet.
You will do this through your internet browser; this can be done on a computer, ipad, or on your phone.  Go to the website: Hover.to
Once you go there, search your customer’s Job ID to find your customer. See the screenshot below.  The Job ID is 6902
If you manually created the hover (which you should not be doing) you will have to just search for the customer’s hover that you manually created.
Once you open the file, you will click “export”. See screenshot below
You will then download the ESX. See screenshot below
ESX is at the very bottom. Once you click that checkbox next to it, press download.  
The most effective way to get this to your adjuster is to: 
Email this file to yourself. 
Download the document(s) on your computer, phone or iPad.
Compose a new email and send it to your adjuster. (This way you can write the subject, write the note, and it should have your signature at the bottom of the email.)`,

To: Property & Casualty Insurers
Re: Clarification of Bulletin No. 97-1: Coverage of Aluminum Siding Claims,
Including Claims for Mismatch
*************************************************************************************
The purpose of this Bulletin is to update Bulletin No. 97-1 to take into consideration
policy language that was not in existence at that time concerning an insurer’s obligation for a
claim to replace damaged aluminum siding, which results in a mismatch in color shade, texture,
or dimension.
In 1997, the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) issued Bulletin No. 97-1
regarding claims to replace aluminum siding due to damage caused by a covered peril under a
“replacement cost” homeowners insurance policy. The Bulletin noted that replacement of
damaged siding with new siding may result in a mismatch between existing siding and newly
installed siding due to color shade, texture or dimension. Bulletin No. 97-1 advised that if a
mismatch occurs, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other less visible
areas of the house to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged
siding on one or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or a monetary allowance to
reflect diminution in value of the house caused by mismatch. Bulletin No. 97-1 also noted that
the law does not require a replacement cost policy to ensure in every instance the replacement of
all siding, including undamaged siding, in order to eliminate or minimize mismatching. At the
same time, the MIA advised that insurers whose settlement practices failed to take into account
major differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions would be subject to
administrative action`,

    content: `Aluminum Siding Claims
MIA BULLETIN NO. 97-1
The Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) has received numerous complaints
from homeowners concerning the settlement practices of insurers of claims for damage to
aluminum siding from hail. These complaints allege practices by insurers of paying to
replace only those portions of siding that are physically damaged without regard to the
mismatching between existing and new siding. Failure to adjust such claims in accordance
with policy provisions or the company’s own operations or settlement guidelines may result
in a finding that the insurer is in violation of Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code. This
Bulletin reiterates long-standing MIA policy regarding the settlement of such claims.
The MIA interprets Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, in the following manner
as to claims for aluminum siding damage under a covered peril made under a “replacement
cost” homeowner’s policy. The replacement of damaged siding with new siding may result in
mismatched siding between the existing siding and the newly replaced siding. In such cases
of mismatching, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other areas of the
house to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged siding on
one or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or an allowance to reflect
diminution in value of the house caused by the mismatch. While the MIA does not interpret a
replacement cost policy to require in every instance, replacement of all siding including
undamaged siding in order to minimize mismatching, insurers whose settlement practices fail
to take into account major differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions as
provided above may be subject to action under Section 230A.
Insurers should inform their insureds of any appraisal rights under the policy where
there is disagreement on the amount of a covered loss. See COMAR 09.30.75

Our Culture & Your Commitment
Our Mission:
At Roof-ER, our mission is to hold a fiduciary responsibility to our customers - plain and simple. In
an industry known for poor workmanship, lack of communication, and at times, outright deceit; we
seek to restore the name of exterior remodeling contractors nationwide. By committing to our core
values of Integrity, Quality, and Simplicity, we promise to deliver an experience every homeowner
wants when remodeling their home: a simple and straightforward quality installation for a fair and
honest price.
Our Core Values:
Integrity: At Roof-ER, we set the standard for Integrity in an industry that has lost credibility among
many consumers. We do not only set the standard of integrity with our clients, but it starts with
being honest to ourselves. We have the courage to truly see ourselves, recognize where we can
grow, and implement changes to meet the demands of reality.
Quality: We guarantee the highest Quality in our products and services. Our confidence in our craft
propels us into the elite 1% of all roofing companies in the entire nation. Quality starts with the
moment a client interacts with one of our representatives at the door. The Quality demonstrated in
every aspect of what we do continues to make Roof-ER the gold standard of this industry.
Simplicity: We strive to deliver an overwhelmingly positive experience for everyone who interacts
with Roof-ER. By embracing the complexities of our industry, we provide exceptional results to our
clients. Our clients value the Simplicity of partnering with us – we guarantee a seamless process
from start to finish ensuring satisfaction with the final outcome.
Your Commitment:

    content: `Arbitration Information
Binding Arbitration
Legally enforceable like a court decision.
Both parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final.
No appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).
Once the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply — often enforced in court if needed.
Example: An insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via
binding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that
amount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.
Non-Binding Arbitration
The arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.
Either party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.
Often used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.
Example: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and
decides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.
Important for Insurance Claims:
Binding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.
Most policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.
Virginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it —
it can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.

To whom it may concern,
Please see the attached video link and photo report of the attempted repair for the claim number
[#_____]. As can be clearly seen in the video and pictures, the homeowner's roof sustained
additional damage during the attempted repairs. This confirms a failed brittle test for the shingles,
indicating irreparability.
With this fact established, your estimate as it currently stands would not actually fix the damages,
but would in fact further compromise the integrity of the roof as a whole. Therefore I have gone
ahead and attached an estimate below that accurately reflects the full scope of work necessary to
make our mutual client whole again.
YouTube Link:
fl[USE THIS PARAGRAPH ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES]fl
I also ask that you take note of the before and after pictures of the attempted repair. Due to the
brittleness of the roof in general, during the repair the two rows of shingles above the one we were
attempting to replace sustained unavoidable mechanical creasing. These photos clearly
demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably
do further damage to surrounding shingles.

This is the call you will make to your HO as soon as you receive the estimate
“Hello sir/ma’am! It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. How’s it going?”
“Great, well we just received the decision from the insurance company.  We’re going to have to take some steps to get this turned around.  I have already submitted my photo report that demonstrates the damage to your property and the need to replace your whole roof, so hopefully they review and approve that.  Could you please reach out to the adjuster to see if they were able to review my report?”
After HO answers. “Thank you! During that call, please let them know that you disagree with their current decision and would like to have your property reinspected if they are not able to update their current decision to a full approval based on the photo report that I sent them.”
If there are some approved shingles:
“So we will also be conducting an iTel and Repair Attempt. 
“An iTel is where we will take a shingle off your roof and send it in to get tested to verify that it is discontinued.  Since it is discontinued, the only effective way to restore your property would be with a full roof replacement.
“At that time, I will also take a video of us removing and replacing that shingle.  This Repair Attempt video will demonstrate to the insurance company that your roof is not repairable and therefore would need to be fully replaced.
“To get those scheduled, I will need you to sign these 2 documents allowing us to do that.  When you see the documents, it will have a cost attached, but don’t worry! Read the bold print and you will see that you, as the homeowner, are never responsible for this cost.”
Schedule a time to meet with the HO to sign or let them know you will be sending it out for eSign.  Task the proper people for eSign, if necessary.
“We will definitely be putting in the work to give you the highest chance of getting this turned around. I definitely believe your roof has the damage that wa`,

This is the conversation you will have with the HO after an adjuster meeting
If moving to Estimate Pending:
“Great! The Adjuster/Ladder Assist identified all the same damage as me.  You will be receiving an email from us shortly saying that you’ve been fully approved.  Within a few days you should receive the itemized estimate from the Insurance Company.  Once you receive that, you can forward that to me. This is going to include every line item that the insurance company believes is needed to make you whole again. To you this is going to look like gibberish. But, don’t worry, that’s what we’re here for. If for some weird reason the desk adjuster does not write it for a full approval after this inspection, I will take the steps necessary to get it turned around! Any questions on that, sir/ma’am?”
Answer any questions
“When the insurance company generates their estimate, it will also typically trigger the release of the first payment. The insurance company refers to this payment as the ACV. Which stands for Actual Cash Value. That amount will be used as your down payment.  The remaining funds are held by the insurance company until we complete the work. They refer to these remaining funds as Depreciation. Which is not “depreciation” as most would think about it, it’s just their way of holding on to some of the funds to make sure the work gets done.
“At the same time our office will be reviewing your entire project along with my photos and the insurance estimate. As I’ve mentioned, insurance companies are always trying to save money.  We usually find specific line items that are missing. Most commonly, code items like IWS and Drip Edge. We will supplement for all the items needed to complete your project to code and our manufacturer’s specifications. Don’t worry, like we have agreed to from the beginning, we guarantee you that you would not have to cover any of these costs even if the insurance company were to deny our supplement. [Which d`,

*** Please note that every insurance company/ individual adjuster has slightly different timeline based on multiple variables. Below is what we can typically expect:
Step 1: Schedule Adjuster Meeting 
Assigned insurance adjuster will reach out within 1-3 business days to schedule their inspection of your property 
If you have interior or would like to make sure you are home for the inspection, please schedule and let me know so I can fit it into my calendar 
Otherwise, please have the adjuster call me directly to schedule 
THE most important part to me helping you get fully approved… is that I am here for the insurance company’s inspection. 
Step 2: Adjuster Meeting
This meeting will typically be scheduled within 1-2 weeks of filing the claim varying based on the adjuster’s current work load. 
I will arrive 30 minutes prior to the scheduled adjuster meeting time to set up my ladder.
After the inspection, we will knock on your door to recap our inspection and to communicate the next steps. If you are not home, I will call you to let you know how things went. 
Step 3: Approved Scope of Work
Within 5 business days, the insurance company will provide an itemized estimate of the approved scope of work.
If we have not received anything within a week of the adjuster meeting, we will begin following up with you and the insurance company directly
Once you have received their written documentation please email that directly to myself and estimates@theroofdocs.com`,

    content: `Insurance Pushback & Arguments Playbook (Q1–Q100)
Q1: Adjuster says: 
“We don’t see enough damage to warrant replacement.”
Short Answer (with source):
Our photo report shows functional storm damage (creases, missing shingles) beyond repair. This requires full replacement .
Detailed Answer (Email Draft):
To whom it may concern,
Please see the attached photo report documenting storm-related damage on multiple slopes. The photos clearly show creased and missing shingles, which are consistent with functional wind damage and cannot be repaired without causing further harm. Per standard industry practice, this constitutes irreparability, and a full replacement is required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. We respectfully request that your estimate be revised accordingly .
Q2: Adjuster says: 
“Hail is cosmetic and doesn’t affect function.”
Short Answer (with source):
Hail damage is not cosmetic — it causes granule loss, mat fractures, and sealant bond failures, per GAF .
Detailed Answer (Email Draft):
To whom it may concern,
Your denial states that hail damage is cosmetic only. However, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, hail impact causes functional issues such as granule loss, cracks in the asphalt mat, and compromised sealant bonds. These defects accelerate roof deterioration and shorten lifespan, making the roof irreparable. For these reasons, this damage cannot be dismissed as cosmetic. Please update your estimate to reflect full roof replacement .
Q3: Carrier says: 
“Shingles can be patched.”
Short Answer (with source):
The iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued; patching would cause mismatches and fail manufacturer standards .
Detailed Answer (Email Draft):
To whom it may concern,
Your position that the roof can be patched is not consistent with the findings of the attached iTel report, which confirms that the installed shingles are discontinued. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, no comparable replacements exist. Mixing discontinued shing`,

Subject: Claim # [Insert Claim #] – Roof Scope Revision Request

To Whom It May Concern,

This is [REP NAME] with Roof-ER. I am assisting [CUSTOMER NAME].

Attached are:
• Photo report documenting roof damage
• iTel report confirming discontinued or mismatched shingles
• GAF manufacturer guidelines recommending full replacement
• Building code references on slope and flashing

Because patch repair is not feasible due to material discontinuation, manufacturer requirements, and code compliance, the only way to restore [CUSTOMER NAME]’s property is full roof replacement.

Please review these findings and provide a revised estimate accordingly.

[Signature & Contact Info]
🛠 Repair Attempt / Brittle Test Argument
Repair attempt photos/videos show shingles cracking during manipulation. This confirms a failed brittle test and irreparability, requiring full replacement.
📑 Discontinued Shingle / iTel Argument
iTel report confirms shingles are discontinued. Suggested alternatives are incompatible in size, require bulk orders, or do not bond correctly with existing shingles. Patch repair is not viable.
🏭 GAF Manufacturer Guidelines
GAF Storm Damage Guidelines (TAB-R-2011-126): If more than 2–3 shingles per plane are damaged, complete replacement is recommended.

GAF Slope Replacement Bulletin (TAB-R-164, 2024): Replacing a single plane requires full removal of underlayment and ridge/hip connections. This reinforces the need for full section replacement.
📏 Building Code Arguments
Virginia Code R905.2.2: Asphalt shingles permitted only on slopes ≥2/12. Lower slopes require flat/low-slope systems.

Flashing Code 90`,

Initial Pitch
“Hi, how are you? My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that specializes in helping homeowners get their roof replaced, paid for by their insurance!”  
Generic:
“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Philadelphia/Maryland over the past few months that have done a lot of damage! 
“We’re already working with your neighbors. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved through their insurance company to have their roof  replaced.”
Initial Pitch
“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do,  I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”
Pause here – Wait for them to respond/agree.
Once they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.
Go in for a handshake. “What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am (your name).  Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”
“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I will give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”

Attached are:
• Our photo report documenting additional siding damage
• An iTel report confirming the siding is discontinued
• Code references requiring proper installation and weather barrier compliance

Because the siding is discontinued and repairs would cause consequential damage, patch repair is not a cost-effective or code-compliant solution. The only way to restore [CUSTOMER NAME]’s property is full siding replacement on all elevations.

Please review these findings and provide a revised estimate accordingly. If additional inspection is required, I will gladly meet your adjuster on-site.

Thank you for your time and cooperation in restoring [CUSTOMER NAME]’s home.

📑 Discontinued Siding Argument (Insert into Email if Applicable)
Per the attached iTel report, the existing siding is discontinued. There are no similar matches available. Even if a special order was attempted, it would require painting/matching that would not be cost-effective or compliant. The only way to make the homeowner whole is full siding replacement on all elevations.
📏 Code Requirement Argument
Per Maryland IRC 2018 R703.2 & R703.4, exterior walls must have a continuous weather-resistant barrier and flashing that overlaps correctly. To achieve this, housewrap must overlap at corners, requiring removal of adjacent siding panels. This removal causes consequential damage, making patch repair impractical or impossible.

Virginia ICC Building Code also requires that damaged siding not be reinstalled (ICC 2021).

    content: `Roof-ER Top 10 Quick Facts Cheat Sheet
1. Failed Repair = Full Replacement:
If shingles crack/break during manipulation (brittle test), repairs are not possible.
Use Repair Attempt Template.
2. Discontinued Shingles:
Use GAF's discontinued list or iTel to prove repairs cannot be blended.
Mixing old/new is not acceptable.
3. Slope Rule (Virginia):
Asphalt shingles only allowed on slopes 2/12 or greater.
Flatter slopes must use flat roof system.
4. Siding Replacement (Maryland):
Per code, housewrap & barrier required.
Replacement of siding is often unavoidable due to code + mismatch issues.
5. Flashing:
Code requires replacing damaged/rusted flashings.
Insurance cannot demand reuse.
6. Storm Damage = Replacement:
GAF states latent hail/wind damage (granule loss, cracks, mat exposure)
leads to roof failure.
Patch repairs not reliable.
7. Partial Approvals:
GAF slope replacement guidelines show disturbing adjacent slopes
requires full replacement of adjoining sections.
8. Insurance Weather Data:
Always ask which source they used.
Counter with iTel or HailTrace reports.
9. Mismatch (Maryland):
Bulletin 18-23 requires insurers to address shade/texture mismatch.
Elsewhere, argue loss of value + discontinued product.
10. Escalation Path:
(1) Template fi (2) Code/Manufacturer Support fi (3) Homeowner Complaint
fi (4) Arbitration/Appraisal if needed.

To Whom it May Concern
This is [REP NAME] with Roof ER.  I am the contractor assisting [CUSTOMER’S NAME].  Attached you will find [MAKE SURE TO EDIT THIS SECTION FOR WHAT DOCUMENTS YOU ARE ACTUALLY ATTACHING] my photo report [AND/OR], an iTel Report, [AND/OR] a repair estimate that includes the siding.
[INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO YOUR EMAIL]
Damage
You will find our photo report in the list of attachments citing additional damage not accounted for in (insurance)'s original estimate. This damage is consistent with what has already been approved which leaves us and the homeowner unsure why these findings were left off of the estimate. [Additional details as needed]
Discontinued
This estimate is for a full siding replacement due to the existing siding being discontinued. Per the attached iTel report, there are no similar matches available and so our estimate accounts for all elevations of siding.
The current siding is discontinued.  The similar siding that is available would have to be special ordered and paint matched.  Because of those things, it would not be a cost-effective solution to restore [HOMEOWNER’s] siding.  The only way to effectively make them whole again would be with full siding replacement.
Code/Housewrap
Per building code, we are required to install a house wrap on exterior wall sheathing to prevent moisture from getting to the building envelope. Further, we are required to follow the manufacturer's installation instructions while applying the weather barrier. These instructions state we must overlap`,

Welcome to Roof-ER!
Meet the Owner:
My name is Oliver Brown. I founded this company in 2019, not because I have a passion for roofing or because I was born into a family of contractors, but because I saw an opportunity. An opportunity to change the reputation of roofing companies and contractors as a whole. This is an industry that is known for lack of communication, poor workmanship, used car sales techniques and straight up deceit by companies who still write up quotes with a pen and paper. With a little bit of modern thinking, integrity and hard work we’ve been able to build a strong brand and reputation in a relatively short amount of time. From $2.5m in year one, as a one man sales team to $20m in 2023, we are one of the fastest growing roofing companies in the DMV. That growth has only been possible by attracting like minded people who are looking to change their lives and those around them… And we are just getting started! 
We have ambitions of growing up and down the east coast and eventually becoming a national brand. To accomplish this we need to continue to add and develop hungry, competitive team members who are dedicated to the big picture but disciplined to execute on a day to day basis. 
Welcome to your new career!
My name is Reese Samala, Director of Sales, here at Roof-ER! I will be spending your first week here with you.  I am excited to see what you accomplish here with us.
A quick introduction of who I am:
I am a medically retired Infantryman`,

Q501 – When should I involve my Team Leader?
Guidance: Involve your Team Leader when you’ve documented properly, tried a rebuttal, and the adjuster still won’t move. They step in before escalation to management.

Q502 – What’s the escalation order at Roof-ER?
Guidance: Start with teammates → Team Leader → Sales Manager.

Action Coaching: If stuck after Sales Manager review, move to arbitration or complaint filing.

Q503 – How do I prep a Photo Report correctly?
Guidance: Always include slope overviews, close-ups of each damage type, and overall house context.

Knowledge: Use the Photo Report Template.docx as the structure.

Q504 – When do I use the Repair Attempt Template?
Guidance: When the carrier insists shingles are repairable.

Action Coaching: Perform a documented repair attempt → use photos + form → escalate with evidence if repair fails.

Q505 – When do I use the iTel Template?
Guidance: When shingles are discontinued or unavailable.

Knowledge: The iTel report confirms unavailability and is strong evidence for full slope replacement.

Q506 – When should I cite manufacturer guidelines?
Guidance: Anytime the carrier suggests repair instead of replacement.

Knowledge: Use GAF Storm Damage Guidelines.pdf or GAF Slope Replacement.pdf to show repair voids warranty.

Q507 – Why is documentation critical before escalation?
Guidance: Documentation shows you followed process. Without it, escalation has no weight.

Action Coaching: Never escalate without a complete photo set + template use.

Q508 – How do I explain matching law to a homeowner?
Guidance: Explain that state laws (like Maryland’s) require repairs to be reasonably uniform in color/quality.

Knowledge: Use Maryland Insurance Administration Matching Requirement.pdf as the reference.

Q509 – When do I file a complaint vs. arbitration?
Guidance: File a complaint when the carrier ignores law or drags feet. Use arbitration when there’s dispute over policy interpretation`,

    content: `Q- How are you handy?
I’m handy because I’m built around your world at Roof-ER.
Here’s why:
Everything is preloaded with YOUR docs – I’m not guessing or giving generic answers. I’ve got all your Roof-ER templates, codes, GAF requirements, iTel reports, discontinued lists, and even your sales training. When you ask for help, I can instantly grab the right piece.

I speak insurance & roofing – Whether it’s brittle tests, siding mismatch, slope code, or storm damage arguments, I know how to frame it in adjuster language and back it with codes and manufacturer guidelines .

I save you time in the field – Instead of digging through folders or trying to remember which template fits, I can hand you the exact one in seconds, already tailored.

I’ve got your escalation paths covered – From homeowner complaint forms to arbitration info , I know the next step when insurance stonewalls you.

I keep it Roof-ER focused – My mission isn’t general roofing advice. It’s helping you close claims, hit bonuses, and protect homeowners — the same goals laid out in your sales training .

👉 Basically: I’m like your pocket project manager + claim coach + code book + sales trainer rolled into one.
Want me to show you a sample workflow — like how I’d walk you through a partial denial siding claim step by step, with the right doc, code, and pushback language?
yes
 Let’s run a sample workflow for a Partial Denial Siding Claim.
Here’s exactly how I’d guide you step by step in the field:
Scenario
Insurance approved 1 elevation of siding, but denied full replacement.
1️⃣ Immediate Response – Pick the Right Template
➡ Use the Siding Argument Template .
This doc has prebuilt arguments for:
Additional damage photos

Discontinued siding (via iTel & Discontinued List)

Code/Housewrap requirements (MD R703 or VA building code)

2️⃣ Supporting Evidence
📌 Discontinued Product
Check iTel report → If siding is discontinued, attach report.

Cross-reference with Discontinued Shingle/Siding list .

    content: `What is a homeowners deductible?
- A homeowners insurance deductible is the amount a homeowner
must pay out of pocket before their insurance coverage applies.
When a claim is approved, the insurance company will cover the
total damage cost minus the deductible amount.
- The terminology can be confusing, it may be helpful to think of it as
a copay, like when you go to the doctor.
- It is important to note that if a deductible is not paid, there can be
legal consequences and any deprecation and/or PWI will be
forfeited.
To whom is the deductible paid to?
- You don’t pay your deductible directly to the insurance company
like a bill. Instead, it’s deducted from your claim payout. You'll
cover the remaining amount—your deductible—when paying the
contractor or company repairing the damage.
Per-Claim Basis:
- It is important to note that homeowners insurance deductibles
diFer from health insurance deductibles in that they are paid on a
per-claim basis (per event), whereas a health insurance deductible
has a maximum annual out of pocket.
Let’s Run Two Examples:
- In the first example, let’s say your deductible is $2,000 and you file
a claim for storm damage to your roof. The insurance company
then approves the work for $20,000. The insurance writes the
estimate, subtracts the deductible, and pays out $18,000 while the
remaining $2,000 (your deductible) is paid to the contractor.
- Now let’s suppose your deductible is $1,000, and you file a claim
for storm damage to your gutters. The insurance company
approves the claim and estimates the repair cost at $900. Since the
repair cost is less than your deductible, you’ll be responsible for
covering the full amount.
Here’s what insurance companies and reporting agencies say:
• Allstate
• Travelers
• Rocket Mortgage
• USAA
• State Farm
• Forbes
• Policygenius

    content: `Documentation & Templates (Q101–Q125)
Q101: Question: 
When should the Repair Attempt Template be used?
Short Answer (with source):
Use when a repair was attempted and shingles cracked, tore, or failed — proving irreparability .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
The Repair Attempt Template should be used anytime a repair test is performed and the shingles crack, tear, or break when manipulated. This template documents the attempt and outcome, proving to insurance that repairs are not feasible. It provides a professional, standardized way to present irreparability .
Q102: Adjuster says: 
“Repair attempt wasn’t necessary.”
Short Answer (with source):
Repair attempts are industry standard to determine reparability .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair attempts are an industry-accepted method to test whether shingles are repairable. Our documented attempt caused additional damage, confirming brittleness and irreparability. This supports the need for full replacement .
Q103: Homeowner asks: 
“Why did you damage my roof during testing?”
Short Answer (with source):
The brittle test is standard and proves shingles can’t be repaired .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
The brittle test may look like damage, but it’s an industry-accepted method to confirm whether shingles are repairable. By carefully attempting to lift and reseal shingles, we document whether they fracture. If they do, as in this case, it proves irreparability and strengthens your claim for full replacement .
Q104: Carrier says: 
“Your repair attempt caused the damage.”
Short Answer (with source):
Damage during repair attempt proves brittleness, not contractor error .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve stated our repair attempt caused the damage. In reality, the cracking during the attempt is the proof of brittleness and irreparability. The Repair Attempt Template documents this result. Repairs would`,

[Use the following APPLICABLE arguments]
Per the attached iTel report, there are no similar matches available which makes a patch repair impossible
Per the attached iTel report, the existing shingle is discontinued. We have attempted to contact the suppliers listed on the report to secure the suggested samples, however each supplier noted [they do not carry the suggested product/the suggested product would need to be special-ordered by the pallet, meaning the costs to do so would be more exorbitant than simply replacing the roof]. As a result, the approved scope of work cannot be completed as currently written.
(Homeowner's) shingles are the English-dimension architectural shingles which are no longer in production. The new metric-dimension shingles have a larger exposure size and for that reason, cannot be mixed with the existing shingles via a repair. If we try to repair with the new shingles, the sealant on the shingle above would not secure to the correct portion of the new underlying shingle. The sealant would be secured to the granules on the underlying shingle - any reputable contractor knows a proper repair cannot be completed in this fashion.

Q301: Carrier says: 
“Drip edge isn’t required in Virginia.”
Short Answer (with source):
Virginia building code requires drip edge at eaves and rakes .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve denied drip edge installation. Per Virginia Building Code and flashing requirements, drip edge is required at all eaves and rakes when reroofing. Excluding it violates state code .
Q302: Adjuster says: 
“Step flashing can be reused in Virginia.”
Short Answer (with source):
Virginia requires replacement when roofing is disturbed .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve said step flashing can be reused. Per Virginia flashing codes, step flashing must be replaced when roof covering is removed. Reuse fails inspection and violates code .
Q303: Carrier says: 
“Valley flashing doesn’t need replacement.”
Short Answer (with source):
Virginia requires valley flashing replacement on reroof .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve excluded valley flashing. Per Virginia flashing requirements, valley flashing must be replaced during reroofing. Reuse is not code-compliant .
Q304: Homeowner asks: 
“Why replace flashing if it looks fine?”
Short Answer (with source):
Code requires flashing replacement when disturbed .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
Even if flashing looks fine, Virginia code requires replacement whenever roofing is removed. This ensures watertight protection and compliance .
Q305: Adjuster says: 
“Ice barrier isn’t required in Virginia.”
Short Answer (with source):
Virginia code requires ice barrier in regions with ice dams .
Detailed Answer (Training Draft):
To whom it may concern,
You’ve denied ice barrier. Per Virginia building code, an ice barrier is required at eaves in areas prone to ice damming. Omission is a violation .
Q306: Carrier says: 
“Old felt can remain.”
Short Answer (with source):
Virginia requires new underlayment on reroof .
