## Building Codes (IRC - International Residential Code)

### Asphalt Shingle Slope Requirements
**Code:** 2021 IRC Section R905.2.2
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (Current in Virginia as of 1/18/2024)

> "Asphalt shingles shall be used only on roof slopes of two units vertical in 12 units horizontal (2:12) or greater."

**When to Use:**
- When insurance approves shingles on slopes flatter than 2:12
- When adjusters question why flat roof systems are required
- For low-pitch rear additions or porches

**Example Script:**
"Per Virginia Residential Building Code Section R905.2.2, asphalt shingles are only allowed on roof slopes of 2/12 or greater. This rear slope measures 1/12, therefore a flat/rubber/TPO roofing system must be installed to comply with state building code."

**When to Use:**
- When replacing siding and insurance questions house wrap cost
- When adjusters suggest reusing old barrier
- For siding replacement estimates

**Example Script:**
"IRC Section R703.2 requires water-resistive barrier behind all exterior wall veneer. When replacing siding, new barrier must be installed per code. Insurance cannot require reuse of damaged or missing barrier."

## GAF Manufacturer Guidelines

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE - PENDING VERIFICATION

The following GAF guidelines are commonly cited but require additional verification:

#### GAF Storm Damage - Repair Limit
**Claim:** "GAF's guideline to not repair any more than 2 or 3 shingles"
**Status:** ⚪ UNABLE TO VERIFY
**Risk Level:** HIGH

**CAUTION:**
This is cited 197 times in our materials but cannot be verified from public sources. GAF Technical Bulletin R-126 exists but is access-restricted.

**DO NOT USE** until official GAF documentation is obtained and verified.

**Action Required:** Obtain GAF Technical Bulletin R-126 for verification.

---

#### GAF Slope Replacement - Adjacent Slopes
**Claim:** "Disturbing adjacent slopes requires full replacement of adjoining sections"
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**CAUTION:**
GAF Technical Bulletin R-164 requires 4-6 inch underlayment overlap when working on adjacent slopes but does NOT explicitly mandate "full replacement."

**Verified GAF Requirement:**
- New underlayment must overlap 4-6 inches onto adjacent slope
- Proper integration required for warranty coverage

**What's Unclear:**
Whether GAF requires full replacement or just proper underlayment integration.

**Recommendation:**
Use precise language: "GAF requires proper underlayment integration with 4-6 inch overlap when replacing one slope" (rather than claiming "full replacement required").

---

#### GAF Lifetime Warranties
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (General information accurate)

**Key Points:**
- Lifetime coverage requires GAF Lifetime Shingles
- Requires minimum 3 qualifying GAF accessories for full system warranty
- Specific terms vary by product
- Warranty covers manufacturing defects, not workmanship

**When to Use:**
- Explaining GAF warranty benefits to homeowners
- Product selection discussions
- Quality differentiation

- "IRC R903.2.1 requires ice barriers" (wrong section number)
- "GAF says you can't repair more than 3 shingles" (unverified)
- "Code requires full replacement of adjacent slopes" (overstated)

### ✅ DO SAY:
- "Per 2021 IRC Section R905.2.2, asphalt shingles require..."
- "IRC Section R905.1.2 specifies ice barrier requirements..."
- "According to manufacturer guidelines..." (when verified)
- "Based on GAF Technical Bulletin R-164, proper underlayment integration requires..."

## When Challenged on Code Citations

### If Adjuster Questions Your Code Citation:

1. **Stay Professional:** "Let me verify the exact section number with you."

2. **Cite Precisely:** Give full code reference including version
   - Example: "2021 International Residential Code, Section R905.2.2"

3. **Offer Documentation:** "I can provide the code text and section if needed."

4. **Know Your Source:** Have code book or ICC Digital Codes available

5. **Escalate if Needed:** If adjuster disputes verified code, escalate to supervisor
