## Troubleshooting

### If /api/admin/run-migrations returns 404:
- Code not fully deployed yet
- Wait a few minutes for Railway build to complete
- Check Railway dashboard for build logs

### If migrations fail:
- Check DATABASE_URL is set in Railway environment variables
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Check Railway logs for detailed error messages

### If no data appears:
- Make sure you ran migrations FIRST, then population
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Verify database connection in Railway dashboard

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Railway dashboard:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  (should already exist)
DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN=2670ce30456644ddad56a334786a3a1a
ABACUS_DEPLOYMENT_ID=6a1d18f38
```
