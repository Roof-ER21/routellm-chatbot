# Susan Knowledge Base - Critical Action Items

**Generated:** October 24, 2025
**Priority:** URGENT - Some items affect 197+ active references

---

## üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY (Complete in 24-48 hours)

### Action Item #1: Verify GAF "2-3 Shingles" Repair Limit

**Status:** UNABLE TO VERIFY - BLOCKS 197 REFERENCES

**Problem:**
- Susan's knowledge base states: "GAF's guideline to not repair any more than 2 or 3 shingles"
- This claim appears **197 times** throughout training data
- Cannot verify from public sources
- GAF Technical Bulletin R-126 exists but is access-restricted

**Why This Matters:**
This is Susan's most frequently cited manufacturer guideline. If inaccurate, it undermines:
- Rep credibility with insurance adjusters
- Legal standing in disputes
- Trust in Susan's other recommendations

**How to Complete:**
1. Contact GAF contractor services or technical support
2. Request official copy of Technical Bulletin R-126 "Replacement of Storm Damaged Shingles"
3. Document exact wording of repair limitations
4. Verify if "2 or 3 shingles" is accurate or if different limit applies
5. Update knowledge base if language needs correction

**Resources Needed:**
- GAF contractor account or contact
- Technical bulletin access
- Authorization to update training data

**Estimated Impact:** 197 references may need updating

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY (Complete within 1 week)

### Action Item #2: Fix IRC Section Number Error (R903.2.1)

**Status:** OUTDATED REFERENCE - AFFECTS 10 LOCATIONS

**Problem:**
- Knowledge base references "IRC R903.2.1" for ice barrier requirements
- This section DOES NOT EXIST in current 2021 IRC
- Correct section is **R905.1.2**

**Why This Matters:**
When reps cite non-existent code sections:
- Building officials will correct them
- Reduces professional credibility
- May confuse insurance adjusters

**How to Complete:**
1. Search knowledge base for all instances of "R903.2.1"
2. Review context to confirm it refers to ice barriers
3. Replace with "R905.1.2" (current 2021 IRC section)
4. Verify context still makes sense after update
5. Test updated responses with sample queries

**Search Terms:**
- "R903.2.1"
- "903.2.1"
- "Section R903"

**Estimated Impact:** 10 chunks need updating

### Action Item #3: Clarify GAF Slope Replacement Requirements

**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED - AFFECTS 24 LOCATIONS

**Problem:**
- Knowledge base states: "GAF slope replacement guidelines show disturbing adjacent slopes requires full replacement of adjoining sections"
- GAF Technical Bulletin R-164 requires 4-6" underlayment overlap
- Does NOT explicitly mandate "full replacement"
- Susan may be overstating the requirement

**Why This Matters:**
Overstating requirements can:
- Lead to unnecessary replacement recommendations
- Cause insurance pushback on legitimate claims
- Create liability if homeowner spends unnecessarily

**How to Complete:**
1. Obtain GAF Technical Bulletin R-164 (publicly available)
2. Review exact language about adjacent slope work
3. Determine if "full replacement" is required or just "proper underlayment integration"
4. Update 24 references with precise language
5. Create talking points for reps about the distinction

**Nuance to Capture:**
- What GAF actually requires vs. what may be practically necessary
- Warranty implications of partial slope work
- When full replacement is recommended vs. required

**Estimated Impact:** 24 references need clarification

## üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY (Complete within 2 weeks)

### Action Item #4: Add Code Version References

**Current State:**
Codes are cited without version numbers (e.g., "IRC R905.2.2")

**Improvement:**
Add version and effective dates (e.g., "2021 IRC R905.2.2, effective in Virginia as of 1/18/2024")

**Why This Matters:**
- Different states adopt different IRC versions
- Codes update every 3 years (2021, 2024, 2027)
- Specificity increases credibility

**How to Complete:**
1. Identify which IRC version applies in each service area
2. Add version numbers to major code references
3. Note effective dates where relevant
4. Create jurisdiction-specific variations if needed

---

### Action Item #5: Create Quick Reference Card for Reps

**Purpose:**
Give reps verified, quotable text for most common code citations

**Should Include:**
- IRC R905.2.2 (slope requirements) - exact text
- IRC R703.2 (water barriers) - exact text
- IRC R703.4 (flashing) - exact text
- Maryland Bulletin 18-23 - key provisions
- Verified GAF guidelines (after Action Items #1 and #3 complete)

**Format:**
- One-page PDF
- Mobile-friendly
- Copy-paste ready text
- Source citations included
