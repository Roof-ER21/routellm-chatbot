## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-monitoring:** Creating surveillance state that damages trust
2. **Under-tuning:** Too many false positives lead to alert fatigue
3. **Ignoring context:** Not all flagged queries are threats
4. **Poor documentation:** Insufficient evidence for investigations
5. **Delayed response:** Slow action on critical alerts causes damage
6. **Legal non-compliance:** Violating employee privacy rights
7. **Siloed approach:** Security operating without HR/Legal involvement
8. **Static patterns:** Not updating as threats evolve
9. **No training:** Team unprepared to respond effectively
10. **Reactive only:** No preventive measures or culture building

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is this legal to implement?
**A:** Generally yes, but requirements vary by jurisdiction. Consult legal counsel, ensure proper employee notification, and follow privacy laws. Some jurisdictions require consent or collective bargaining agreements.

### Q: How do I handle false positives?
**A:** Document them, tune thresholds, add context to patterns, and use them to improve the system. A <10% false positive rate is typical and acceptable.

### Q: What if an employee asks why they're being monitored?
**A:** Be transparent. Explain that all employees are subject to the same monitoring as outlined in company policy for security and compliance purposes.

### Q: Should I tell employees about this system?
**A:** Disclosure requirements vary by location. Best practice is transparency through acceptable use policies and employee handbooks.

### Q: How do I balance security with employee trust?
**A:** Use proportional monitoring, maintain transparency, focus on genuine threats, protect privacy, and couple with positive culture-building initiatives.

### Q: Can this detect all insider threats?
**A:** No system is perfect. This detects many common patterns, but sophisticated or low-tech threats may evade detection. Use as one layer in defense-in-depth.

### Q: How much does implementation cost?
**A:** Varies widely based on organization size and existing infrastructure. Budget for software/tools, implementation labor, ongoing monitoring, and training. ROI comes from prevented losses.

### Q: What about remote workers?
**A:** Same principles apply. Focus on data access patterns, VPN usage, and cloud activity monitoring rather than physical presence.
