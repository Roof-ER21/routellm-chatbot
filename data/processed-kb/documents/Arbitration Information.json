  "extractedText": "Arbitration Information\n\n Binding Arbitration\n\nLegally enforceable like a court decision.\n\nBoth parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final.\n\nNo appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).\n\nOnce the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply — often enforced in court if needed.\n\n Example:An insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via binding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that amount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\n\n\n\n Non-Binding Arbitration\n\nThe arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.\n\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\n\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\n\n Example:The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and decides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\n\n\n\n Important for Insurance Claims:\n\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\n\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\n\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it — it can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.\n\n\n\n",
