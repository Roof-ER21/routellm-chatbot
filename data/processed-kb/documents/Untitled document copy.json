That would only apply if the homeowner had a matching endorsement on their policy.  \n\n\n\nHowever, there are still plenty of arguments to use outside of matching requirements:\n\nRepairability (using Brittle Test or Repair Attempt)\n\nDiffering dimensions not allowing for a proper repair\n\nMissed storm damage to the areas not yet approved for replacement\n\nOther possibilities based on other information that has not yet been provided\n\n\n\n",
