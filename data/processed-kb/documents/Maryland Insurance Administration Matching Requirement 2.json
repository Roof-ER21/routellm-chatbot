  "extractedText": "Aluminum Siding Claims\nMIA BULLETIN NO. 97-1\nThe Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) has received numerous complaints\nfrom homeowners concerning the settlement practices of insurers of claims for damage to\naluminum siding from hail. These complaints allege practices by insurers of paying to\nreplace only those portions of siding that are physically damaged without regard to the\nmismatching between existing and new siding. Failure to adjust such claims in accordance\nwith policy provisions or the company’s own operations or settlement guidelines may result\nin a finding that the insurer is in violation of Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code. This\nBulletin reiterates long-standing MIA policy regarding the settlement of such claims.\nThe MIA interprets Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, in the following manner\nas to claims for aluminum siding damage under a covered peril made under a “replacement\ncost” homeowner’s policy. The replacement of damaged siding with new siding may result in\nmismatched siding between the existing siding and the newly replaced siding. In such cases\nof mismatching, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other areas of the\nhouse to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged siding on\none or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or an allowance to reflect\ndiminution in value of the house caused by the mismatch. While the MIA does not interpret a\nreplacement cost policy to require in every instance, replacement of all siding including\nundamaged siding in order to minimize mismatching, insurers whose settlement practices fail\nto take into account major differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions as\nprovided above may be subject to action under Section 230A.\nInsurers should inform their insureds of any appraisal rights under the policy where\nthere is disagreement on the amount of a covered loss. See COMAR 09.30.75\nQuestions should be directed to Jean Bienemann, Associate Commissioner for\nProperty and Casualty, 410-468-2301.\n\u0001\n__________________________\nSteven B.
