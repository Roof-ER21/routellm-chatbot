  "extractedText": "What is a homeowners deductible? \n \n- A homeowners insurance deductible is the amount a homeowner \nmust pay out of pocket before their insurance coverage applies. \nWhen a claim is approved, the insurance company will cover the \ntotal damage cost minus the deductible amount. \n \n- The terminology can be confusing, it may be helpful to think of it as \na copay, like when you go to the doctor. \n \n- It is important to note that if a deductible is not paid, there can be \nlegal consequences and any deprecation and/or PWI will be \nforfeited. \n \nTo whom is the deductible paid to? \n \n- You don’t pay your deductible directly to the insurance company \nlike a bill. Instead, it’s deducted from your claim payout. You'll \ncover the remaining amount—your deductible—when paying the \ncontractor or company repairing the damage. \n \nPer-Claim Basis: \n \n- It is important to note that homeowners insurance deductibles \ndiFer from health insurance deductibles in that they are paid on a \nper-claim basis (per event), whereas a health insurance deductible \nhas a maximum annual out of pocket. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nLet’s Run Two Examples: \n \n- In the first example, let’s say your deductible is $2,000 and you file \na claim for storm damage to your roof. The insurance company \nthen approves the work for $20,000. The insurance writes the \nestimate, subtracts the deductible, and pays out $18,000 while the \nremaining $2,000 (your deductible) is paid to the contractor. \n \n- Now let’s suppose your deductible is $1,000, and you file a claim \nfor storm damage to your gutters. The insurance company \napproves the claim and estimates the repair cost at $900. Since the \nrepair cost is less than your deductible, you’ll be responsible for \ncovering the full amount. \n \n \nHere’s what insurance companies and reporting agencies say: \n• Allstate \n• Travelers \n• Rocket Mortgage \n• USAA \n• State Farm \n• Forbes \n• Policygenius \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nInsurance Claim Example (USAA):",
