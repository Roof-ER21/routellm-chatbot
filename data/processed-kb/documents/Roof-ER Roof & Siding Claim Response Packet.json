This confirms a failed brittle test and irreparability, requiring full replacement.\n\n📑 Discontinued Shingle / iTel Argument\n\niTel report confirms shingles are discontinued. Suggested alternatives are incompatible in size, require bulk orders, or do not bond correctly with existing shingles. Patch repair is not viable.\n\n🏭 GAF Manufacturer Guidelines\n\nGAF Storm Damage Guidelines (TAB-R-2011-126): If more than 2–3 shingles per plane are damaged, complete replacement is recommended.GAF Slope Replacement Bulletin (TAB-R-164, 2024): Replacing a single plane requires full removal of underlayment and ridge/hip connections. This reinforces the need for full section replacement.\n\n📏 Building Code Arguments\n\nVirginia Code R905.2.2: Asphalt shingles permitted only on slopes ≥2/12. Lower slopes require flat/low-slope systems.Flashing Code 908.5: Rusted/damaged flashing must be replaced.

Available substitutes require special orders and paint matching, which are not cost-effective or compliant. Only full siding replacement restores the home.\n\n📏 Code Requirement Argument\n\nMaryland IRC R703.2 & R703.4: Requires continuous water-resistant barrier and proper flashing. Housewrap must overlap at corners, requiring removal of adjacent siding.
