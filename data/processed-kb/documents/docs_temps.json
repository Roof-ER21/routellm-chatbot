  "extractedText": "Documentation & Templates (Q101–Q125)\n\n\n\nQ101: Question: \n\nWhen should the Repair Attempt Template be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when a repair was attempted and shingles cracked, tore, or failed — proving irreparability .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe Repair Attempt Template should be used anytime a repair test is performed and the shingles crack, tear, or break when manipulated. This template documents the attempt and outcome, proving to insurance that repairs are not feasible. It provides a professional, standardized way to present irreparability .\n\n\n\nQ102: Adjuster says: \n\n“Repair attempt wasn’t necessary.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nRepair attempts are industry standard to determine reparability .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair attempts are an industry-accepted method to test whether shingles are repairable. Our documented attempt caused additional damage, confirming brittleness and irreparability. This supports the need for full replacement .\n\n\n\nQ103: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why did you damage my roof during testing?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nThe brittle test is standard and proves shingles can’t be repaired .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe brittle test may look like damage, but it’s an industry-accepted method to confirm whether shingles are repairable. By carefully attempting to lift and reseal shingles, we document whether they fracture. If they do, as in this case, it proves irreparability and strengthens your claim for full replacement .\n\n\n\nQ104: Carrier says: \n\n“Your repair attempt caused the damage.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nDamage during repair attempt proves brittleness, not contractor error .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve stated our repair attempt caused the damage. In reality, the cracking during the attempt is the proof of brittleness and irreparability. The Repair Attempt Template documents this result. Repairs would cause more harm, confirming the need for replacement .\n\n\n\nQ105: Question: \n\nWhen should the Generic Partial Template be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when insurance approves only part of a roof/siding but evidence supports more .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .\n\n\n\nQ106: Adjuster says: \n\n“We only approved the slope with visible damage.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nOur inspection found collateral damage across multiple slopes .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve approved one slope only. Our inspection and photo report show consistent collateral damage across multiple slopes. Storm impact is not limited to a single slope. The Generic Partial Template language applies to request revision .\n\n\n\nQ107: Carrier says: \n\n“We left gutters out — no evidence of damage.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPhoto report shows gutter dents and granule wash consistent with storm .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou omitted gutters. Our photo report shows storm-related dents and granule washout in gutters. These are valid storm impacts that must be included. The Generic Partial Template can be used to request full scope .\n\n\n\nQ108: Adjuster says: \n\n“We’ll cover siding on one wall only.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nMaryland matching requirement prohibits mismatched siding .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYour approval of one siding wall ignores matching requirements. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless excluded by policy. The Generic Partial Template applies to request full replacement .\n\n\n\nQ109: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why do we need the Generic Partial Template?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nIt challenges partial approvals by showing all affected areas .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe Generic Partial Template is needed when the insurance company tries to pay for only part of the damage. It uses standardized language to point out that storm damage affected more than just one slope or wall. It helps push for full approval .\n\n\n\nQ110: Question: \n\nWhen should the Photo Report Template be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse whenever submitting photographic proof of damage to insurance .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe Photo Report Template should be used whenever you compile photographic evidence of storm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .\n\n\n\nQ111: Adjuster says: \n\n“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPhoto report documents creases, mat exposure, and missing shingles .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed our photos. The Photo Report Template clearly documents creased shingles, exposed mats, and missing tabs. These conditions are functional damage, not cosmetic, and require replacement .\n\n\n\nQ112: Carrier says: \n\n“Collateral damage isn’t covered.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCollateral (gutters, metals, screens) helps prove storm event .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded collateral. Our photo report documents dents in gutters and metals. These items confirm storm event impact and must be considered when determining full scope .\n\n\n\nQ113: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why are photos important if the adjuster already inspected?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPhotos create a permanent record and highlight missed damage .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nPhotos are essential because they provide a permanent, timestamped record of storm damage. Even if an adjuster inspected, photos highlight missed or overlooked issues. The Photo Report Template ensures this evidence is presented clearly .\n\n\n\nQ114: Adjuster says: \n\n“Your photos don’t show hail size.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nDamage, not hail size, determines coverage — shown in report .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed our photos due to hail size. Insurance coverage is based on damage, not size. Our photo report documents functional impacts: bruises, granule loss, and fractures. These require replacement regardless of stone size .\n\n\n\nQ115: Carrier says: \n\n“Photos aren’t professional evidence.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPhoto reports are industry standard for claim documentation .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve stated photos aren’t valid evidence. In fact, photo reports are an industry standard and form part of nearly every claim review. They are recognized as valid proof of storm damage .\n\n\n\nQ116: Question: \n\nWhen should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier delays, denies, or refuses fair inspection. Insurance companies respond more seriously when the request comes directly from their policyholder. This template ensures the homeowner speaks in the right language .\n\n\n\nQ117: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why do I need to send the letter instead of Roof-ER?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nInsurance responds more when it comes from the policyholder .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nInsurance companies must respond directly to their customers. When Roof-ER sends a letter, it may not carry the same weight. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures the homeowner applies pressure themselves, often getting faster results .\n\n\n\nQ118: Carrier says: \n\n“We already explained our decision.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCustomer letter reinforces their rights and requests reconsideration .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nThe policyholder has the right to challenge your decision. Using the Customer-to-Insurance Template, they’ve reiterated their request for fair handling and restoration to pre-loss condition. A customer’s direct appeal requires serious consideration .\n\n\n\nQ119: Homeowner asks: \n\n“What if I don’t feel comfortable pushing insurance?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nWe provide the template — they just copy/paste it .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe homeowner doesn’t need to “fight” with insurance. They simply copy/paste the provided Customer-to-Insurance Template into an email and send it. Roof-ER provides the wording; the customer’s role is only to hit send .\n\n\n\nQ120: Adjuster says: \n\n“Customer letters don’t change anything.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCarrier must respond when request comes from policyholder .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said customer letters don’t matter. However, you are required to respond directly to the policyholder. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures their request is framed clearly. This obligates a reconsideration under fair claims handling .\n\n\n\nQ121: Question: \n\nWhen should the Siding Argument Template be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mismatches, or because removal of housewrap causes consequential damage. It standardizes the language for challenging siding denials .\n\n\n\nQ122: Adjuster says: \n\n“We’ll just replace one siding panel.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPanel removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing damage .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve proposed panel replacement. Per our siding argument documentation, removing one panel requires detaching adjoining ones and often the corner post. This causes consequential damage and makes panel-only replacement infeasible .\n\n\n\nQ123: Carrier says: \n\n“We found a close match.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\niTel confirmed no reasonable match exists; close isn’t acceptable .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve stated a close siding match exists. The iTel report confirms no reasonable match is available. Color and profile mismatches reduce property value and fail to restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ124: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why can’t you just paint or blend siding?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPainting/mixing voids warranty and doesn’t restore pre-loss condition .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nPainting or blending siding may seem like a solution, but it voids manufacturer warranty and doesn’t restore the home to its pre-loss condition. The Siding Argument Template explains why only full replacement is acceptable .\n\n\n\nQ125: Adjuster says: \n\n“Housewrap isn’t necessary for siding repair.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nMD Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier behind siding .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve denied housewrap during siding repair. Per Maryland Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting WRB violates code and risks moisture intrusion. This must be included .\n\nQ126: Carrier says: \n\n“We can repair aluminum siding dents.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nAluminum siding dents are permanent; replacement required .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be replaced to restore pre-loss condition .\n\n\n\nQ127: Adjuster says: \n\n“We’ll just replace a few vinyl panels.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nVinyl becomes brittle with age; panel removal causes cracking .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve approved only a few vinyl siding panels. Per our siding argument, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks when removed, making panel-only replacement impossible. Full wall replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ128: Carrier says: \n\n“We’ll blend new siding with old.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nBlending creates mismatched color/profile; iTel confirms no match .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve proposed blending new with old siding. The iTel report confirms no suitable match is available. Mixing profiles and colors creates mismatches and does not restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ129: Homeowner asks: \n\n“What if siding mismatch doesn’t bother me?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nInsurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nEven if mismatches don’t bother the homeowner, insurance is obligated to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. Per our siding argument, mismatched siding reduces value and fails to meet claim requirements .\n\n\n\nQ130: Carrier says: \n\n“We’ll paint siding to match.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPainting voids warranty and fades differently than factory siding .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve suggested painting new siding to match. Per our siding argument, painting siding voids manufacturer warranty and fades unevenly compared to factory finish. This is not a valid repair. Replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ131: Question: \n\nWhen should the Estimate Request Template be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when insurance estimate omits items or underpays scope .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe Estimate Request Template is used whenever the insurance estimate is incomplete — missing items like flashing, underlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .\n\n\n\nQ132: Adjuster says: \n\n“Our estimate is final.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nNew evidence requires revision — outlined in Estimate Request Template .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said the estimate is final. The Estimate Request Template provides standardized language to show new documentation (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires revision of your estimate. We respectfully request corrections .\n\n\n\nQ133: Carrier says: \n\n“We don’t owe for code compliance.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nEstimate Request Template cites VA/MD code upgrades .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve denied code items. The Estimate Request Template language cites specific state codes, such as Maryland Code R703 (WRB) and VA Code 908.5 (flashing). These are not optional — they are code requirements that must be included .\n\n\n\nQ134: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why is your estimate higher than insurance’s?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nWe include all code-required and manufacturer-required items .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nOur estimate may be higher because it includes all code-required upgrades and manufacturer-required components that insurance sometimes leaves out. The Estimate Request Template is how we push back to ensure these are included .\n\n\n\nQ135: Adjuster says: \n\n“We don’t pay for underlayment.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nGAF requires new underlayment; reusing voids warranty .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF installation standards, new underlayment must be installed when reroofing. Reusing underlayment voids warranty. The Estimate Request Template language requests this correction .\n\n\n\nQ136: Carrier says: \n\n“We don’t owe for flashing.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nFlashing replacement required by VA Code 908.5 .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, all damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced when reroofing. This is a code requirement, not optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .\n\n\n\nQ137: Adjuster says: \n\n“We priced shingles too low.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nEstimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nThe shingle pricing in your estimate is below current market value. The Estimate Request Template provides language to request market-appropriate pricing corrections. This ensures the claim reflects actual replacement costs .\n\n\n\nQ138: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why did insurance’s estimate leave items out?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCarriers often omit code/manufacturer items — we use Estimate Request Template to fix .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nInsurance estimates frequently omit items like drip edge, flashing, or WRB. These omissions reduce the payout. We use the Estimate Request Template to point out and correct these errors so the homeowner receives full coverage .\n\n\n\nQ139: Carrier says: \n\n“We don’t pay for WRB.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nMaryland Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded WRB. Per Maryland Code R703, siding must include a water-resistive barrier. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement and requests correction .\n\n\n\nQ140: Adjuster says: \n\n“We don’t owe for ridge vent.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nRidge vents must be removed for slope replacement; new required .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing slopes and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template requests this correction .\n\n\n\nQ141: Carrier says: \n\n“We don’t owe for drip edge.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nIRC requires drip edge at eaves and rakes .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded drip edge. Per the IRC adopted in Virginia, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement for correction .\n\n\n\nQ142: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why do you need to send estimate corrections?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCorrections ensure code compliance and fair market value .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nWe send estimate corrections to ensure all code-required items and market-appropriate pricing are included. Without corrections, homeowners are left with underfunded claims. The Estimate Request Template makes these corrections formal .\n\n\n\nQ143: Adjuster says: \n\n“Your corrections aren’t valid.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCorrections are backed by manufacturer guidelines and state code .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve rejected our corrections. The Estimate Request Template is based on manufacturer requirements and building code citations. These are not optional suggestions; they are mandatory. Corrections must be made .\n\n\n\nQ144: Carrier says: \n\n“Your estimate inflates costs.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nOur estimate includes only code and manufacturer-required items .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve stated our estimate inflates costs. In reality, our estimate includes only what is required by building code and manufacturer standards. The Estimate Request Template ensures we justify these inclusions .\n\n\n\nQ145: Adjuster says: \n\n“We don’t cover valley flashing.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nVA Code 908.5 requires flashing replacement .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded valley flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during reroofing. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement .\n\n\n\nQ146: Carrier says: \n\n“We don’t owe for chimney flashing.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nIRC requires flashing at all penetrations .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded chimney flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing is required at all penetrations, including chimneys. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\n\n\n\nQ147: Adjuster says: \n\n“We don’t pay for skylight flashing.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nSkylight flashing must be replaced when roof is replaced .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations. Skylight flashing cannot be reused and must be replaced. The Estimate Request Template addresses this correction .\n\n\n\nQ148: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCode citations make corrections undeniable .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nWe cite building code in our estimate corrections because it eliminates subjectivity. Carriers cannot deny items required by law. The Estimate Request Template ensures each correction is supported by code .\n\n\n\nQ149: Carrier says: \n\n“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nGAF requires starter strips at eaves/rakes for wind warranty .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind warranty. The Estimate Request Template ensures these are included .\n\n\n\nQ150: Adjuster says: \n\n“We don’t cover ridge caps.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nRidge caps must be replaced when slopes are replaced .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .\n\nQ151: Question: \n\nWhen should the iTel Template be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when shingles/siding are discontinued and repairs would cause mismatches .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe iTel Template is used whenever a carrier suggests patching, but iTel testing confirms the shingles or siding are discontinued. By citing iTel’s lab analysis and the Discontinued Shingle List, it proves no suitable replacement exists and full replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ152: Adjuster says: \n\n“We found similar shingles available.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\niTel confirmed no match exists; mixing voids manufacturer warranty .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve suggested similar shingles are available. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued with no acceptable match. Installing mismatched shingles violates manufacturer warranty and reduces property value. Full replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ153: Carrier says: \n\n“Metric shingles can replace English dimension.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nMetric and English shingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent proper sealant alignment. This misalignment voids warranty and fails to restore pre-loss condition .\n\n\n\nQ154: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why can’t you just mix old and new shingles?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nMixing creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant alignment .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nMixing discontinued shingles with new ones creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant placement. These differences compromise wind resistance and void manufacturer warranty. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms no compatible products are available .\n\n\n\nQ155: Adjuster says: \n\n“We’ll only replace damaged shingles, not full slope.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\niTel confirms discontinued; partial replacement isn’t possible .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve proposed replacing only visibly damaged shingles. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued. Since replacements cannot match, partial repairs would be defective. Full slope replacement is the only solution .\n\n\n\nQ156: Carrier says: \n\n“We can still patch siding with a close match.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nClose match isn’t acceptable; iTel confirms discontinued siding .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve suggested patching siding with a close match. The iTel analysis confirms the siding is discontinued and no match exists. Mismatched siding reduces property value and violates Maryland matching regulations .\n\n\n\nQ157: Homeowner asks: \n\n“What is an iTel report?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\niTel is a lab test confirming material type and availability .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nAn iTel report is a laboratory analysis of a material sample (shingle, siding, etc.). It confirms product type, manufacturer, and whether it is still available. If discontinued, it provides written proof repairs are not feasible .\n\n\n\nQ158: Carrier says: \n\n“We don’t accept iTel reports.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\niTel is independent lab analysis widely accepted in the industry .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and provide objective proof of discontinuation .\n\n\n\nQ159: Adjuster says: \n\n“Shingles look available at Home Depot.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nRetail stores don’t confirm compatibility; iTel confirms discontinuation .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve stated similar shingles appear in retail stores. Availability at retail does not guarantee dimensional compatibility. The iTel report confirms the original shingles are discontinued and no suitable match exists .\n\n\n\nQ160: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why does discontinued matter if roof still works?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nDiscontinued means no repairs possible without mismatching .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nIf shingles are discontinued, no replacements match in size, color, or sealant alignment. This makes repairs impossible without mismatching. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms when a roof system can no longer be patched, requiring full replacement .\n\n\n\nQ161: Carrier says: \n\n“We’ll approve repair, not replacement, despite iTel.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\niTel proves repairs impossible; replacement is required .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve approved repair despite iTel findings. The iTel report proves the product is discontinued, making repairs impossible without mismatches. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .\n\n\n\nQ162: Adjuster says: \n\n“We’ll blend different shingle lots.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nLot variations cause color mismatch; iTel confirms no true match .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve suggested blending different lots of shingles. Lot variations cause visible color mismatches, and per the iTel report, the original shingles are discontinued. No blending can restore uniformity. Full replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ163: Carrier says: \n\n“Discontinued list isn’t proof.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nDiscontinued list + iTel lab analysis confirm unavailability .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .\n\n\n\nQ164: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why can’t you just re-use old shingles?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nOld shingles crack when lifted; repair attempt shows brittleness .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nReusing old shingles isn’t possible because once lifted, they crack or fail to reseal. Our repair attempt video documents brittleness. Combined with discontinued status, reuse is not feasible .\n\n\n\nQ165: Adjuster says: \n\n“New manufacturer products are close enough.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nMixing brands violates warranty and reduces property value .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve proposed using a different manufacturer’s product. Mixing brands voids warranty and creates mismatches in size and color. The iTel report confirms no acceptable alternative exists .\n\n\n\nQ166: Carrier says: \n\n“We’ll pay for only a few discontinued panels.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPartial payment ignores irreparability proven by iTel .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve offered to pay for a few discontinued panels. The iTel report proves no matches exist, so partial repairs aren’t feasible. Full replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ167: Homeowner asks: \n\n“How does iTel help my claim?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nIt provides third-party proof repairs aren’t possible .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nAn iTel report is powerful because it’s a third-party lab test confirming discontinuation. Insurance companies must consider it credible evidence that repairs are not possible. It directly supports full replacement .\n\n\n\nQ168: Adjuster says: \n\n“We don’t need third-party verification.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\niTel provides unbiased lab confirmation; not contractor opinion .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed iTel verification. Unlike contractor opinion, iTel is unbiased lab testing. It confirms material discontinuation in an objective, industry-accepted format .\n\n\n\nQ169: Carrier says: \n\n“We’ll allow repair with different dimensions.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nMixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric sizes do not align, leaving sealant strips misaligned and vulnerable. Repairs are unsafe; full replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ170: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Can insurance force me to accept mismatched materials?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nNo — insurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nNo, insurance cannot force mismatched repairs. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding and roofing are not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in policy. You’re entitled to full replacement .\n\n\n\nQ171: Adjuster says: \n\n“We’ll just caulk or seal damaged shingles.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCaulking is not manufacturer-approved repair; voids warranty .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve proposed caulking damaged shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, caulking is not an approved repair method and voids warranty. Replacement is required .\n\n\n\nQ172: Carrier says: \n\n“We won’t accept discontinued list as evidence.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nDiscontinued list + iTel confirm no replacement available .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed the discontinued list. When paired with iTel lab testing, the Discontinued Shingle List confirms no suitable replacement is available. Together, they provide conclusive proof .\n\n\n\nQ173: Homeowner asks: \n\n“What happens if we can’t match?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCode and regulations require full replacement when mismatching .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nIf a match isn’t possible, full replacement is required. Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 confirms that mismatched siding or roofing isn’t acceptable unless excluded in the policy .\n\n\n\nQ174: Adjuster says: \n\n“We can reuse discontinued shingles from repair stock.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nStored shingles won’t align in color/age; still discontinued .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve suggested using repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .\n\n\n\nQ175: Carrier says: \n\n“We’ll patch siding with leftover stock.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nLeftover siding won’t match aged/weathered walls; iTel confirms discontinued .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve suggested using leftover siding stock. These pieces won’t match weathered siding on the home, and the iTel report confirms the line is discontinued. Patching with leftovers does not restore pre-loss condition .\n\nQ176: Question: \n\nWhen should the Arbitration Template be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when carrier denies all appeals and homeowner seeks neutral review .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nThe Arbitration Template should be used when all internal appeals with the insurance company have been exhausted and the carrier maintains denial. It initiates a neutral review process where an arbitrator evaluates the dispute. This forces the carrier to defend their denial against documented evidence .\n\n\n\nQ177: Carrier says: \n\n“Denial is final and not appealable.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nArbitration is a valid escalation option under policy rights .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve stated the denial is final. Per the Arbitration Information template, the policyholder maintains the right to escalate unresolved disputes through arbitration. This process ensures fair claim handling beyond internal review .\n\n\n\nQ178: Homeowner asks: \n\n“What is arbitration?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nArbitration is a neutral third-party review of the claim .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nArbitration is when a neutral third-party arbitrator reviews the evidence from both sides — homeowner and carrier — and makes a binding or advisory decision. It’s an escalation step if the carrier refuses to honor valid claim documentation .\n\n\n\nQ179: Carrier says: \n\n“Arbitration doesn’t apply here.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nIf policy includes arbitration, carrier must participate .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration. If the policy includes arbitration provisions, the carrier must participate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .\n\n\n\nQ180: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nArbitration is faster, cheaper, and still binding .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nArbitration avoids the delays and costs of lawsuits while still offering neutral review. It’s faster, more affordable, and often binding depending on policy terms. The Arbitration Template helps initiate this option effectively .\n\n\n\nQ181: Question: \n\nWhen should Complaint Forms be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when carrier mishandles claim or refuses fair handling .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nComplaint Forms should be used when an insurance company delays, denies, or mishandles a claim unfairly. Filing with the state insurance administration creates oversight and pressures carriers to comply with fair claims practices .\n\n\n\nQ182: Carrier says: \n\n“State complaints won’t change our decision.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nComplaints trigger regulatory oversight carriers must respond to .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said complaints won’t matter. Filing a state complaint forces regulatory oversight. Carriers must respond to the state authority, creating accountability in claim handling .\n\n\n\nQ183: Homeowner asks: \n\n“What happens after I file a complaint?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nThe state reviews carrier actions and demands formal response .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nAfter you file a complaint, the state insurance administration reviews the carrier’s handling of your claim. The carrier must provide a formal written response. This often leads to claim reconsideration .\n\n\n\nQ184: Adjuster says: \n\n“Complaints are just paperwork.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nComplaints document mishandling and force carrier accountability .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed complaints as meaningless. In fact, complaints document mishandling and force accountability under state oversight. Carriers must provide a formal justification, often leading to fairer outcomes .\n\n\n\nQ185: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Will filing a complaint hurt my claim?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nNo — it enforces fair handling and protects your rights .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nFiling a complaint will not hurt your claim. Instead, it enforces fair handling by requiring the carrier to justify their decisions to regulators. The Complaint Form process protects your rights .\n\n\n\nQ186: Carrier says: \n\n“We don’t recognize state complaints.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCarriers are required by law to respond to complaints .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said you don’t recognize state complaints. By law, carriers must respond to oversight inquiries. Filing a Complaint Form compels this response and ensures review of claim handling .\n\n\n\nQ187: Question: \n\nWhen should both Arbitration and Complaint Forms be used?\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nUse when carrier refuses reconsideration and claim is unresolved .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nBoth Arbitration and Complaint Forms should be used when a carrier refuses reconsideration despite documentation. Arbitration applies policy provisions for neutral review, while complaints trigger state oversight. Together, they maximize pressure for resolution .\n\n\n\nQ188: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Which should I do first: arbitration or complaint?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nComplaint first for oversight; arbitration if still unresolved .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nGenerally, filing a complaint first is recommended because it creates regulatory oversight. If the carrier still refuses, then proceed to arbitration. Both paths are valid, but this order applies the most pressure .\n\n\n\nQ189: Carrier says: \n\n“We won’t change claim regardless of oversight.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nOversight and arbitration hold carriers accountable by law .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve stated oversight won’t affect your decision. State regulators and arbitration provisions exist specifically to hold carriers accountable. Ignoring either is a violation of fair claim handling .\n\n\n\nQ190: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Do many people file complaints?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nYes — complaints are common and effective for unfair denials .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nYes, many homeowners file complaints when claims are unfairly denied or delayed. The Complaint Form process is standard and often leads to faster, fairer resolution .\n\n\n\nQ191: Carrier says: \n\n“We won’t respond to arbitration.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nPolicy provisions require participation once initiated .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .\n\n\n\nQ192: Adjuster says: \n\n“Arbitration is just advisory.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nMany arbitration decisions are binding per policy terms .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said arbitration is advisory only. Many policies make arbitration binding. Even when advisory, arbitrators’ decisions strongly influence resolution. The Arbitration Template enforces this right .\n\n\n\nQ193: Homeowner asks: \n\n“What if complaint doesn’t work?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nProceed to arbitration or escalate legally .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nIf a complaint doesn’t resolve the issue, the next step is arbitration or legal escalation. Complaints create oversight, but arbitration provides binding or advisory resolution if denial persists .\n\n\n\nQ194: Carrier says: \n\n“Customer has no further rights.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nCustomer has right to complaint, arbitration, and legal action .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve stated the customer has no further rights. In fact, policyholders maintain the right to complaints, arbitration, and legal remedies. Denying these rights is a violation of fair claims practices .\n\n\n\nQ195: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Is complaint filing complicated?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nNo — forms are simple and Roof-ER provides guidance .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nFiling a complaint is straightforward. The forms are simple, and Roof-ER provides the homeowner with templates and step-by-step guidance. The Complaint Forms make the process efficient .\n\n\n\nQ196: Adjuster says: \n\n“Complaints waste time.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nComplaints are official state action carriers must respond to .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said complaints waste time. In reality, complaints initiate state action that requires a carrier response. They are a valid escalation and often change claim outcomes .\n\n\n\nQ197: Carrier says: \n\n“Arbitration is too costly.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nArbitration is faster and cheaper than litigation .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve dismissed arbitration as costly. Arbitration is significantly faster and cheaper than litigation for both sides. It’s a valid escalation provided in many policies .\n\n\n\nQ198: Homeowner asks: \n\n“Will Roof-ER help with complaints/arbitration?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nYes — Roof-ER provides templates and guidance .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nYes, Roof-ER supports homeowners through both complaints and arbitration. We provide templates, documentation, and coaching so customers can file confidently. The Arbitration and Complaint Forms are designed to make this process easy .\n\n\n\nQ199: Carrier says: \n\n“Complaints don’t prove storm damage.”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nComplaints enforce fair handling, not damage proof .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nYou’ve said complaints don’t prove damage. That is correct — complaints enforce fair handling of claims. Damage proof comes from repair attempts, iTel, and photo reports. Complaints ensure carriers treat this documentation fairly .\n\n\n\nQ200: Homeowner asks: \n\n“What’s the final step if all else fails?”\n\nShort Answer (with source):\n\nLegal escalation is last resort after complaint/arbitration .\n\nDetailed Answer (Training Draft):\n\nIf both complaints and arbitration fail, the final step is legal escalation. Roof-ER can provide documentation and guidance, but attorneys handle this stage. Arbitration and complaints usually resolve issues before legal action is needed .\n\n",
