In an industry known for poor workmanship, lack of communication, and at times, outright deceit; we seek to restore the name of exterior remodeling contractors nationwide. By committing to our core values of Integrity, Quality, and Simplicity, we promise to deliver an experience every homeowner wants when remodeling their home: a simple and straightforward quality installation for a fair and honest price.\n\n\n\nOur Core Values:\n\nIntegrity: At Roof-ER, we set the standard for Integrity in an industry that has lost credibility among many consumers. We do not only set the standard of integrity with our clients, but it starts with being honest to ourselves. We have the courage to truly see ourselves, recognize where we can grow, and implement changes to meet the demands of reality.\n\nQuality: We guarantee the highest Quality in our products and services.  Our confidence in our craft propels us into the elite 1% of all roofing companies in the entire nation. Quality starts with the moment a client interacts with one of our representatives at the door.  The Quality demonstrated in every aspect of what we do continues to make Roof-ER the gold standard of this industry.\n\nSimplicity: We strive to deliver an overwhelmingly positive experience for everyone who interacts with Roof-ER.  By embracing the complexities of our industry, we provide exceptional results to our clients.  Our clients value the Simplicity of partnering with us – we guarantee a seamless process from start to finish ensuring satisfaction with the final outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Commitment:\n\n\n\nI will conduct myself in alignment with the Mission and Core Values.\n\nI will dedicate myself to Roof-ER’s successful sales process.\n\nI will always show an exceptional level of integrity when interacting with clients, co-workers, and (especially) myself.\n\nI will listen to and grow from receiving constructive feedback.\n\nI will not be afraid to communicate with the correct individual(s) when I have an issue or grievance.\n\nI will not be involved in gossip or “company drama.”\n\nI will be an effective and contributing member of the Roof-ER team.\n\nI will show an intense level of discipline in the work that I conduct.\n\nI will not let negativity or “bad days” have a detrimental impact on my work ethic and the quality of what I do.\n\nI will have pride in my work.\n\nI will do what it takes to commit to this. I will achieve tremendous levels of success. I have seen the success that others achieved by committing to this process - I WILL be part of that.\n\n\n\n",
