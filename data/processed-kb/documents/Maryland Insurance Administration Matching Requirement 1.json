The Bulletin  noted  that replacement  of \ndamaged  siding  with  new  siding  may  result  in a mismatch between  existing  siding  and  newly \ninstalled siding due  to  color shade,  texture  or  dimension. Bulletin  No.  97-1  advised  that  if  a \nmismatch occurs, settlement  options  include  moving  undamaged  siding  from  other less  visible \nareas  of  the  house  to  replace  damaged  siding,  replacement  of  both  damaged  and  undamaged \nsiding on one or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or a monetary allowance to \nreflect  diminution  in  value  of  the  house  caused  by  mismatch. Bulletin No.  97-1 also noted  that \nthe law does not require a replacement cost policy to ensure in every instance the replacement of \nall  siding,  including  undamaged  siding,  in  order  to eliminate  or  minimize  mismatching. At  the \nsame time, the MIA advised that insurers whose settlement practices failed to take into account \nmajor   differences   in   color   shades,   textures,   or   siding   dimensions would be   subject   to \nadministrative action under Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, which has been recodified as \npresent Title 27, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article. \n \nAt  the  time  MIA  Bulletin  No.  97-1  was  issued, policy  language typically provided \ncoverage for direct physical damage not otherwise excluded in the policy. Since the issuance of \nBulletin 97-1 in   1997, however, most insurance   policies   now   contain policy   language \nspecifically excluding mismatch claims. Terms,  conditions  and  exclusions with  respect  to \nmismatch vary among insurers  and policies. Moreover,  the  specific  language  of  the  individual \ninsurance policy governs the rights, duties and obligations of the insurer and the policyholder.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAL REDMER, JR. \nCommissioner \n \nNANCY GRODIN \nDeputy Commissioner \n \n \nLARRY HOGAN \nGovernor \n \nBOYD K. RUTHERFORD \nLt. Governor \n \n200 St. Paul Place, Suite 2700, Baltimore, Maryland 21202 \n1-800-492-6116   TTY: 1-800-735-2258  \nwww.insurance.maryland.gov \n \n\n \nIn  the absence of specific policy  exclusion for mismatch claims, the advice contained in \nBulletin 97\n-1 still applies. Mismatch exclusions may apply to aluminum siding claims as well as \nother exterior finish materials such as roofing. \n \nWhile most policies now contain a specific exclusion for mismatch claims, some insurers \nalso  offer  optional  coverage  for  mismatch  claims.  This  coverage  is  not  generally  automatically \nincluded  within  a  homeowners  policy,\n  but  may  be  purchased  at  an  additional  cost. The  terms, \nconditions  and  cost  of  such  optional  mismatch  coverage  vary  among  insurers  and  policies.  To \nfind  out  whether  your  insurer  offers  additional  coverage  for  mismatch  claims,  Maryland \nconsumers are encouraged to contact their producer \nor insurer for further information. \n \nFor questions regarding this Bulletin or for further information, please contact the \nMaryland Insurance Administration \nat 410-468-2000 or 800-492-6116. \n \n      Al Redmer, Jr. \n      Commissioner \n \n     By:_____ \n       Joy Hatchette \n       Associate Commissioner \n       Consumer Education and Advocacy \n \n \n \nsignature on original",
