  "extractedText": "Arbitration Information\nBinding Arbitration\nLegally enforceable like a court decision.\nBoth parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final.\nNo appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).\nOnce the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply — often enforced in court if needed.\nExample: An insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via\nbinding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that\namount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.\nNon-Binding Arbitration\nThe arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.\nEither party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.\nOften used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.\nExample: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and\ndecides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.\nImportant for Insurance Claims:\nBinding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.\nMost policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.\nVirginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it —\nit can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.\n\nComplaint Forms\nHave HO use these websites to submit a complaint\nAllstate:\nNationwide:\nUnder “What is your Email About” Select “General Inquiries”\nUnder “What is the Subject of your Email” Select “Feedback & Complaints”\nState Farm:\nSelect “Other” on drop down menu, and then click the link that says “this form”\nErie:\nTravelers:\nIf you/HO already sent email(s) to\nUse this link to file a complaint:\nSelect “Give complaint or Share a concern” on the first drop down menu\nThen select “Your Experience” on the second drop down menu\nUnder the “relationship” drop down menu, HO should select “customer”\n(You shouldn’t fill this form out often, but if you do there is an option to select “3rd party)”\nFarmers Insurance:\nGrange:\nSelect “Your Claim/Claim Status” on drop down menu\nHomsite:\nEmail\nLiberty Mutual:\nMercury:\nProgressive:\nClick “Send Email” and then select “Your Claim/Claims Process” on drop down menu\nThe Philadelphia Contributionship:\nUniversal Property Complaint Form:\nSelect “Feedback” on the drop down menu\nUniversal Property Document Sharing:\n\nUse this link when you need to send information/documents to the assigned adjuster at Universal\nProperty\nYou can even write emails in a google docs, download the file, and upload it to ClaimPath as a\n“correspondence letter”\nThe Hartford:\nMake sure HO includes the Claim Number when filling out the complaint\nVirginia Farm Bureau:\nCumberland Mutual\nFill out contact form and make request by using the link\nNorthern Neck\nScroll to the bottom of the page and fill out form there\nAlso has generic email claimreport@nnins.com\nAssurant\nUnfortunately there is no complaint form online.
