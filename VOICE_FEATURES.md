## Browser Support

| Browser | Speech Recognition | Speech Synthesis |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| iOS Safari 14+ | ‚úÖ Full Support | ‚úÖ Full Support |
| Chrome Desktop | ‚úÖ Full Support | ‚úÖ Full Support |
| Chrome Android | ‚úÖ Full Support | ‚úÖ Full Support |
| Edge Desktop | ‚úÖ Full Support | ‚úÖ Full Support |
| Firefox Desktop | ‚ùå Limited | ‚úÖ Full Support |
| Firefox Mobile | ‚ùå No Support | ‚úÖ Full Support |

**Note**: This feature is primarily designed for iOS Safari, which has full support.

## Troubleshooting

### "Speech recognition not supported"
- **Issue**: Browser doesn't support Web Speech API
- **Solution**: Use iOS Safari, Chrome, or Edge

### Microphone permission denied
- **Issue**: User denied microphone access
- **Solution**:
  1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Camera & Microphone
  2. Allow access for the website
  3. Refresh page

### No voices available
- **Issue**: Voices haven't loaded yet (iOS)
- **Solution**: Wait a moment and try again (voices load asynchronously)

### Voice not speaking
- **Issue**: Speech synthesis not working
- **Solution**:
  1. Check Voice of Ra is enabled (gold color)
  2. Check device volume
  3. Check device is not in silent mode (iOS)
  4. Try selecting a different voice

### Transcription inaccurate
- **Issue**: Speech recognition not understanding
- **Solution**:
  1. Speak clearly and at normal pace
  2. Reduce background noise
  3. Use industry-standard terms
  4. Check microphone isn't obstructed

### Hands-free mode not auto-restarting
- **Issue**: Listening doesn't resume after response
- **Solution**:
  1. Disable and re-enable Hands-Free mode
  2. Check no errors in status display
  3. Ensure browser permissions granted

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- GPU-accelerated animations (transform/opacity)
- Debounced state updates
- Lazy voice loading
- Efficient re-renders with useCallback/useMemo

### Mobile Battery
- Voice recognition uses microphone ‚Üí battery drain
- Hands-free mode ‚Üí continuous listening ‚Üí more battery use
- Recommended: Use hands-free sparingly, disable when not needed

### Network Usage
- Speech recognition: Minimal (processed locally on iOS)
- Speech synthesis: None (local processing)
- Chat API: Normal usage

## Accessibility

### Features
- ‚úÖ Large touch targets (64px minimum)
- ‚úÖ High contrast visuals
- ‚úÖ Clear state indicators
- ‚úÖ ARIA labels on buttons
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation support
- ‚úÖ Screen reader compatible

### WCAG Compliance
- **Level AA**: Color contrast ratios met
- **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum (iOS HIG)
- **Visual Feedback**: Multiple indicators (color, animation, text)
- **Error Messages**: Clear and descriptive

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Wake word detection ("Hey Susan")
- [ ] Voice commands (e.g., "send email", "analyze photo")
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Voice activity detection (VAD) for better hands-free
- [ ] Noise cancellation
- [ ] Voice biometrics (speaker identification)
- [ ] Offline mode with local models

### Under Consideration
- Custom voice training
- Voice macros/shortcuts
- Voice analytics (tone, sentiment)
- Integration with dictation APIs

## API Reference

### VoiceService

```typescript
import { voiceService } from '@/lib/voice-service';

  continuous: false,
  interimResults: true
});

// Speech Synthesis
voiceService.speak(text, {
  voice: selectedVoice,
  rate: 1.0,
  pitch: 1.0,
  volume: 1.0
}, {
  onStart: () => {},
  onEnd: () => {},
  onError: () => {}
});

voiceService.stopSpeaking();
voiceService.pauseSpeaking();
voiceService.resumeSpeaking();

// Voices
const voices = await voiceService.loadVoices();
const bestVoice = voiceService.getBestVoice('en-US');
```

### useVoiceRecognition Hook

```typescript
const {
  isListening,
  transcript,
  interimTranscript,
  confidence,
  error,
  isSupported,
  startListening,
  stopListening,
  toggleListening,
  resetTranscript
} = useVoiceRecognition({
  language: 'en-US',
  continuous: false,
  interimResults: true,
  onFinalResult: (transcript, confidence) => {},
  onError: (error) => {}
});
```

  speak,
  stop,
  pause,
  resume,

} = useTextToSpeech({
  rate: 1.0,
  pitch: 1.0,
  volume: 1.0,

  onEnd: () => {}
});
```

### VoiceControls Component

```typescript
<VoiceControls
  onTranscript={(transcript) => console.log(transcript)}
