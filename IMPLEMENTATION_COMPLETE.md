- Do you have photos of the damage?"
```

### AFTER:
```
"Partial approval? Here's how WE'RE going to flip this [1.1][2.3]:

**Step 1**: IRC R908.3 [1.1] requires FULL matching - their partial violates code
**Step 2**: Attach these 3 photos showing extent triggers full replacement [3.2]
**Step 3**: Use this email template (93% success rate in VA [2.1]):

[Complete ready-to-use email script with citations]

Need the escalation path if they push back?"
```

---

## Citation System

### Format: [X.X]
- **[1.X]** = Building codes (IRC, IBC, state codes)

- **[4.X]** = Manufacturer specs, warranty info

### Examples:
- `IRC R908.3 [1.1]` = Building code citation
