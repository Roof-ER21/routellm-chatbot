# Railway Deployment Summary - RouteLLM Chatbot

## Current Status

**Project**: RouteLLM Chatbot - Next.js 15 Application
**Location**: `/Users/a21/routellm-chatbot-railway`
**Status**: Ready for deployment
**Railway CLI**: Installed and available

## What's Been Prepared

### Configuration Files (Ready)
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration with Node.js 20
- ✅ `Procfile` - Process definition
- ✅ `start.sh` - Server startup script
- ✅ Git repository initialized and committed

### Deployment Scripts Created
1. **`quick-deploy.sh`** - One-command deployment script
2. **`deploy-to-railway.sh`** - Full interactive deployment script

### Documentation Created
1. **`DEPLOY_NOW.md`** - Quick deployment guide
2. **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Comprehensive Railway guide

## Environment Variables Configured

### Required (Ready to set)
```
DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN=2670ce30456644ddad56a334786a3a1a
ABACUS_DEPLOYMENT_ID=6a1d18f38
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Optional (Set if needed)
```
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=<your-key>
RESEND_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

## Railway CLI Authentication Required

**Important**: Railway CLI requires interactive browser authentication. This cannot be automated and must be done manually.

### Why Manual Login is Needed
- Railway uses OAuth for security
- Requires browser-based authentication
- Cannot be scripted in non-interactive environments

## Next Steps - Manual Deployment Required

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot-railway
./quick-deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. Prompt you to login via browser (one-time)
2. Create Railway project
3. Set all environment variables
4. Deploy your application
5. Provide production URL

### Option 2: Step-by-Step Manual

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot-railway

# 2. Login to Railway (opens browser)
railway login

# 3. Initialize project
railway init

# 4. Set environment variables
railway variables set DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN=2670ce30456644ddad56a334786a3a1a
railway variables set ABACUS_DEPLOYMENT_ID=6a1d18f38
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production

# 5. Deploy
railway up

# 6. Get your URL
railway status
railway open
```

### Option 3: Deploy via Railway Dashboard

1. Visit https://railway.app
2. Login to your account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose "Empty Project" or "Deploy from GitHub"
5. If using CLI: Run `railway link` in your project directory
6. Add environment variables in dashboard
7. Deploy from dashboard or CLI

## Deployment Process Overview

### What Happens During Deployment

1. **Upload Phase**
   - Code is uploaded to Railway
   - Repository is cloned

2. **Build Phase** (3-5 minutes)
   - Install Node.js 20
   - Run `npm install` (install dependencies)
   - Run `npm run build` (Next.js build)

3. **Deploy Phase** (30 seconds)
   - Execute `./start.sh`
   - Server starts on Railway's PORT
   - Health check on `/` endpoint

4. **Live Phase**
   - Application is live at Railway URL
   - Auto-scaling enabled
   - Monitoring active

## Expected Results

### Successful Deployment Indicators
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ Health check passes (/ endpoint responds)
- ✅ Production URL is accessible
- ✅ Environment variables are set

### You'll Receive
- Production URL: `https://your-project.up.railway.app`
- Deployment dashboard access
- Real-time logs
- Metrics and monitoring

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate Actions
```bash
# View deployment logs
railway logs

# Check deployment status
railway status

# Open Railway dashboard
railway open

# Generate Railway domain
railway domain
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Real-time logs
railway logs --follow

# Check variables
railway variables

# View project status
railway status
```

### Custom Domain (Optional)
```bash
# Add custom domain
railway domain add yourdomain.com

# Or generate Railway domain
railway domain
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Build Failures
```bash
# View build logs
railway logs

# Common issues:
# - Check package.json scripts
# - Verify all dependencies are listed
# - Ensure Node.js version compatibility
```

### Runtime Errors
```bash
# Check runtime logs
railway logs --follow

# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Restart deployment
railway redeploy
```

### Health Check Failures
- Verify `/` endpoint responds
- Check start.sh is executable
- Ensure PORT is configured correctly
- Review health check timeout (300s)
