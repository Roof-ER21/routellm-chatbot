## Implementation Instructions

### For Developers

#### 1. Update System Prompt
Replace or enhance the current system prompt in `/lib/ai-provider-failover.ts` with content from `susan-enhanced-system-prompt.md`.

**Current location (lines 797-828):**
```typescript
let systemPrompt = '';

if (ragContext && ragContext.chunks.length > 0) {
  const formattedContext = ragService.formatContextForPrompt(ragContext);
  systemPrompt = `${formattedContext}

You are Susan AI-21, an expert roofing insurance claim assistant...
```

**Enhancement approach:**
- Keep RAG integration structure
- Replace the system prompt content with the enhanced version
- Maintain code citation and actionable advice focus

#### 2. Add Document Upload Detection
Detect when users upload documents and trigger appropriate questioning patterns.

**Suggested implementation:**
```typescript
// Detect document uploads
const hasUpload = messages.some(m =>
  m.content.includes('[uploaded]') ||
  m.content.includes('[attached]') ||
  // Add your document detection logic
);

if (hasUpload) {
  // Add document questioning guidance to system prompt
  systemPrompt += `\n\n${documentQuestioningContext}`;
}
```

#### 3. Add Estimate Analysis Guard Rails
Implement checks to prevent pricing discussions in estimate analysis.

**Suggested approach:**
- Add post-processing filter to catch pricing language
- Log warnings when pricing terms are detected
- Provide feedback loop to improve prompt adherence

#### 4. Test with Example Scenarios
Use the examples from `example-conversations.md` to validate:
- Estimate analysis follows guidelines (no pricing)
- Persuasive techniques are used naturally
- Document uploads trigger appropriate questions
- Tone calibrates based on context

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Susan Mentions Pricing
**Problem:** Response includes cost estimates or pricing discussion

**Solution:**
- Review `estimate-analysis-guidelines.md` section "Never Mention"
- Add post-processing filter for pricing terms
- Strengthen system prompt guard rails

**Example fix:**
```markdown
CRITICAL: NEVER discuss pricing, costs, or dollar amounts unless the rep explicitly asks "What should this cost?" or similar pricing-specific questions.
```

---

### Issue 2: Too Many Questions
**Problem:** Susan asks 6+ questions, overwhelming the rep

**Solution:**
- Limit to 2-4 strategic questions initially
- Review `document-questioning-patterns.md` for prioritization
- Ask follow-up questions only after initial answers

**Example fix:**
```markdown
LIMIT: Ask maximum 2-4 questions in your initial response. You can ask follow-ups based on their answers.
```

---

### Issue 3: Not Using Persuasive Techniques
**Problem:** Responses are informative but not persuasive

**Solution:**
- Review `persuasive-techniques.md` for patterns
- Emphasize "you" language in system prompt
- Add examples of persuasive phrasing

**Example fix:**
```markdown
ALWAYS use client-focused "you" language:
‚úÖ "Based on what you've shared, would it make sense to..."
‚ùå "I think you should..."
```

---

### Issue 4: Sounds Too Formal/Robotic
**Problem:** Tone is professional but not warm or conversational

**Solution:**
- Add conversational language examples to system prompt
- Review tone guidelines in `susan-enhanced-system-prompt.md`
- Test against example conversations

**Example fix:**
```markdown
TONE: Sound like a helpful colleague, not a formal assistant. Use:
- "Great question!" not "Thank you for your inquiry."
- "Let's figure this out" not "I will analyze this matter."
- "You're in a strong position" not "The situation is favorable."
```
