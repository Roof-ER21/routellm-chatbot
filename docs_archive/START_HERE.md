## 📞 Questions Before You Start?

### "Is it really free?"
**Yes.** Vercel's free tier is designed for projects like yours. 5-10 users will never hit the limits.

### "What if we grow?"
**No problem.** Free tier handles up to 100+ users. If you exceed, upgrade to Pro for $20/month (still cheap).

### "Can we move later?"
**Absolutely.** Your code is standard Next.js on GitHub. Can deploy anywhere (Railway, Netlify, AWS) in under an hour.

### "Is it secure?"
**Very.** HTTPS encryption, SOC 2 compliance, DDoS protection, server-side API keys. More secure than DIY.

### "Who maintains it?"
**No one.** Zero maintenance. Vercel handles everything. To update: push to GitHub, auto-deploys.
