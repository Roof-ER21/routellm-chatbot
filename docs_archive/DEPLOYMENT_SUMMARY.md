## Questions & Answers

**Q: Is Vercel really free forever?**
A: Yes, for your usage level (5-10 users, reasonable traffic). The free tier is designed for projects exactly like yours.

**Q: What if we grow to 50 users?**
A: Still likely free. If you exceed limits, upgrade to Pro ($20/month), still incredibly cheap.

**Q: Can we move off Vercel later?**
A: Absolutely. Your code is standard Next.js, stored on GitHub. Can deploy to Railway, Netlify, AWS, etc. in under an hour.

**Q: Is it secure?**
A: Very. HTTPS encryption, SOC 2 certified, DDoS protection, server-side API keys. More secure than self-hosting without a security team.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: Your code runs on Vercel servers (US-based). User messages go to Abacus.AI (your existing setup). No data stored permanently. Vercel only handles hosting, not data.

**Q: Do we need a developer to maintain it?**
A: No. Zero maintenance required. To update: push to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys. Anyone technical can do it.

**Q: What if Vercel goes down?**
A: 99.99% uptime SLA = 4 minutes downtime/month average. In practice, often 100% uptime. If they have major outage, can deploy to Railway in 30 minutes.
