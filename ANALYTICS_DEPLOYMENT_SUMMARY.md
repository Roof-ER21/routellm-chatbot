## 🚀 NEXT STEPS TO GO LIVE

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration** (5 minutes)
1. Go to your admin panel: `/admin`
2. Click "Run Analytics Migration" button
3. Verify all tables created successfully

### **Step 2: Integrate Tracking** (1-2 hours)
We need to add tracking calls to:

**Chat Interface:**
```typescript
import { trackQuestion, trackChatMessage } from '@/lib/analytics'

// When user asks a question
await trackQuestion({
  question: userMessage,
  category: 'general',
  session_id: sessionId
})

// When Susan responds
await trackChatMessage({
  message_type: 'assistant',
  content_length: response.length,
  session_id: sessionId
})
```

**Email Generator:**
```typescript
import { trackEmailGeneration } from '@/lib/analytics'

// When email is generated
await trackEmailGeneration({
  template_used: selectedTemplate.template_name,
  template_type: selectedTemplate.sender,
  recipient_type: emailType,
  arguments_used: selectedArguments,
  generation_time_ms: endTime - startTime,
  session_id: sessionId
})

// When user copies email
await trackEvent({
  type: 'email_copied',
  category: 'email',
  data: { template: selectedTemplate.template_name }
})
```

**Feedback Buttons (NEW):**
```typescript
// Add to chat messages
<button onClick={() => trackFeedback('susan_wrong', {
  question: question,
  susan_response: response,
  user_comment: 'The code citation was incorrect'
})}>
  ⚠️ Susan was wrong
</button>
```

### **Step 3: Build Admin Dashboard** (2-3 hours)
Create `/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` with:
- Overview cards (users, messages, emails)
- Most asked questions table
- Template usage pie chart
- "Susan was wrong" list
- Feature usage stats
- Real-time activity feed

### **Step 4: Test & Verify** (30 minutes)
- Generate test data
- Verify tracking works
- Check API endpoints
- Review dashboard
