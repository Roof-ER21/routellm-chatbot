# üöÄ Deploy to Railway (5 Minutes) - NO CLI NEEDED

Your code is **100% ready**. Follow these simple steps:

## Method 1: Deploy from Local (Easiest - No GitHub Needed)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repo (1 minute)
```bash
# In your terminal, run:
cd /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot

# Option A: If you have gh CLI authenticated
gh repo create routellm-chatbot --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Option B: Manual
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/new
# 2. Name: routellm-chatbot
# 3. Public
# 4. Don't initialize with anything
# 5. Click "Create repository"
# 6. Then run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/routellm-chatbot.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway (2 minutes)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Open: https://railway.app/dashboard

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click **"New Project"**
   - Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
   - Choose **"routellm-chatbot"**
   - Click **"Deploy Now"**

3. **Railway Auto-Detects Everything!**
   - ‚úÖ Finds `railway.json`
   - ‚úÖ Runs `npm install`
   - ‚úÖ Runs `npm run build`
   - ‚úÖ Starts with `npm start`

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables (1 minute)

In Railway Dashboard:
1. Click on your deployed service
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"Add Variable"** for each:

```
DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN = 2670ce30456644ddad56a334786a3a1a
ABACUS_DEPLOYMENT_ID = 6a1d18f38
```

4. Click **"Deploy"** to restart with new variables

### Step 4: Get Your URL & Test

1. In Railway Dashboard, click **"Settings"** tab
2. Find **"Domains"** section
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. Copy the URL (e.g., `susan-ai-21.up.railway.app`)
5. **Test PDF upload!**

## Method 2: Deploy WITHOUT GitHub (Alternative)

If you can't get GitHub working, Railway supports direct uploads:

### Using Railway CLI (requires browser login once)

```bash
cd /Users/a21/routellm-chatbot

# Login (opens browser once)
railway login

# Create project
railway init

# Set variables
railway variables set DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN="2670ce30456644ddad56a334786a3a1a"
railway variables set ABACUS_DEPLOYMENT_ID="6a1d18f38"

# Deploy
railway up
```

## ‚úÖ What Makes This Work (vs Vercel)

| Feature | Railway | Vercel |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Server Type** | Real server | Serverless functions |
| **PDF Libraries** | ‚úÖ Works (pdf-parse) | ‚ùå Fails (no native deps) |
| **Build** | Node.js environment | Edge runtime |
| **Cost** | $5-10/month | Free (but PDFs don't work) |

---

## üéØ Expected Result

**Before (Vercel):**
```
[ClientPDFExtractor] Page 1/2 extracted, length: 0
[ClientPDFExtractor] Page 2/2 extracted, length: 0
‚ùå No text extracted - generic AI response
```

**After (Railway):**
```
[DocumentProcessor] Processing PDF with pdf-parse...
[DocumentProcessor] Extracted 1,847 characters
‚úÖ Full document analysis with specific details
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Railway logs (click "View Logs")
- Verify `railway.json` exists
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is used

### PDF Still Not Working
- Check environment variables are set
- Look for `[DocumentProcessor]` logs
- Verify pdf-parse@1.1.1 installed

### App Won't Start
- Check `npm start` command exists in package.json
- Verify port binding (Railway sets PORT env var)
- Look for startup errors in logs

## üöÄ Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
gh repo create routellm-chatbot --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# 2. Go to Railway Dashboard
open https://railway.app/new

# 3. Deploy from GitHub
# 4. Add environment variables
# 5. Test PDF upload

Done! üéâ
```
