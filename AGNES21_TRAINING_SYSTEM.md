## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Expert Mode
```
User: "When should I involve my Team Leader?"

Agnes: "Great question! Per Q501, involve your Team Leader when you've
documented properly, tried a rebuttal, and the adjuster still won't move.
They step in before escalation to management.

The escalation order at Roof-ER (Q502):
1. Teammates
2. Team Leader
3. Sales Manager

Key point: Never escalate without complete documentation (Q506). Make sure
you have a complete photo set and have used the appropriate templates first.

Want to practice a scenario where you need to escalate?"

Citations: [Q501, Q502, Q506]
```

### Example 2: Roleplay with Sarah
```
[Skeptical Veteran Sarah - üëµ]

Sarah: "I've had three contractors look at my roof and they all gave me
different answers. Why should I trust you?"

User: "I understand your concern, Mrs. Johnson. That's actually common because
many contractors focus on what's easiest, not what's right. Let me show you
something - see these granule loss patterns? That's hail damage, and per the
manufacturer's warranty guidelines, spot repairs would void your warranty."

Agnes (in character): "Okay, but how do I know you're not just saying that to
get more money? Can you show me where it says that in writing?"

[After 3 exchanges]

[AGNES COACHING]
Performance Review:
- Confidence: 7/10 - Good start, building credibility with evidence
- Evidence: 8/10 - Strong use of manufacturer guidelines (reference Q506)
- Objection Handling: 6/10 - Address trust concern more directly
- Overall: 7/10 - Solid response, needs more empathy

Strengths: You referenced manufacturer specs which is excellent (Q506).
Physical evidence is persuasive.

Improvements: Lead with empathy first. Try: "I completely understand - if I
were you, I'd be skeptical too after three different opinions. Let me show
you exactly what I'm seeing and then you can decide."

Study: Review Q503 (Photo Report preparation) to strengthen your documentation
approach.

```

### Example 3: Tough Adjuster
```
[Tough Adjuster Mike - üìã]

Mike: "I'm looking at your estimate and I see you're claiming the entire roof
needs replacement. My inspection shows only 15 damaged shingles. We'll approve
a spot repair."

User: "Mike, I appreciate you taking the time to review this. However, per
GAF's manufacturer guidelines, spot repairs on impact damage void the warranty.
Additionally, these shingles are discontinued - we have an iTel report showing
unavailability. The policy requires matching, which means full slope replacement."

Agnes (in character): "I hear what you're saying, but the policy doesn't
specifically require full slope for discontinued shingles. I can approve
closest match available. Send me the iTel report and I'll consider it."

[Coaching would follow after more exchanges]
```
