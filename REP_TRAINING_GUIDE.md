## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Document Analysis Not Working

**Possible Causes:**

- PDF is image-only (scanned, no text)

1. Re-scan document with OCR enabled
2. Use text-based PDF (not scanned image)
3. Manually enter details if PDF won't work

### Problem: Template Recommendation Seems Wrong

**Check:**
- Did you select correct email type?
- Is recipient type clear (adjuster vs homeowner)?
- Does uploaded document match scenario?

**Solution:**
- Click "Change" button to browse all templates
- Select template manually
- Susan will still generate with structure

### Problem: No Arguments Suggested

**Possible Causes:**
- No document uploaded
- Email type is generic

**Solution:**
- Upload the estimate/denial letter
- Select specific email type (not "General")
- Arguments will appear after document analysis

### Problem: Generated Email Seems Generic

**Possible Causes:**
- Didn't upload document
- Didn't select arguments
- Minimal details provided

**Solution:**
1. Upload document for intelligence
2. Select 3-5 arguments
3. Add specific details in "Additional Details" field

## üéì Advanced Tips

### Tip 1: Layer Your Arguments

**Good:** IRC R908.3 alone (92% success)
**Better:** IRC R908.3 + State Code (95% success)
**Best:** IRC R908.3 + State Code + Manufacturer Spec (98% success!)

More supporting evidence = higher success rate

### Tip 2: Use State-Specific When Possible

**Generic:** IRC R908.3 (92%)
**Virginia:** VA Building Code R908.3 (95%)

**Pennsylvania:** PA UCC 3404.5 (90%)

State-specific codes have higher enforcement rates.

### Tip 3: Document Everything

**In your email, mention:**
- iTel report (if you have it)
- Photo documentation
- Repair attempt video

**More evidence = faster approval**

### Tip 4: Follow the Timeline

**Day 1:** Send initial argument email
**Day 7:** Check claim portal
**Day 10:** Send follow-up if no response
**Day 15:** Second follow-up with escalation warning
**Day 20:** Escalate to supervisor/state DOI

Susan has templates for each stage.

### Tip 5: Learn From Success

When you get a claim approved:
1. Note which template you used
