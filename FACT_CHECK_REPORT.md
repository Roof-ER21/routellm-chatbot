## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### üö® CRITICAL ISSUE #1: GAF "2 or 3 Shingles" Repair Limit

**Reference:** "GAF's guideline to not repair any more than 2 or 3 shingles"
**Status:** UNABLE TO VERIFY
**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Problem:**
- This claim appears **197 times** in Susan's knowledge base
- GAF Technical Bulletin R-126 exists but is access-restricted
- Cannot verify the exact "2 or 3 shingles" language from public sources
- This is frequently used in insurance disputes

**Impact:**
If this claim is inaccurate, reps could be making false statements to insurance adjusters, potentially damaging credibility and legal standing.

**Action Required:**
1. Obtain official GAF Technical Bulletin R-126 "Replacement of Storm Damaged Shingles"
2. Verify exact wording of repair limitations
3. Update knowledge base with precise, quotable language
4. If guideline has changed, update all 197 references

**Urgency:** IMMEDIATE - This affects active claims negotiations

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM ISSUE #1: IRC Section Number Error

**Reference:** IRC R903.2.1
**Status:** OUTDATED REFERENCE
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Problem:**
- Knowledge base references "IRC R903.2.1" for ice barrier requirements
- This section number does NOT exist in 2021 IRC
- Correct section is **R905.1.2** (Ice Barrier)
- May be from older IRC versions (2015 or earlier)

**Impact:**
When reps cite "IRC R903.2.1" to building officials or adjusters, they may be corrected, reducing credibility.

**Action Required:**
1. Search all references to "R903.2.1" in knowledge base
2. Update to "R905.1.2" for ice barrier requirements
3. Verify correct section numbers for all IRC references

**Locations:** 10 mentions in chunks related to ice and water barrier discussions

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM ISSUE #2: GAF Slope Replacement Requirement

**Reference:** "GAF slope replacement guidelines show disturbing adjacent slopes requires full replacement of adjoining sections"
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Problem:**
- GAF Technical Bulletin R-164 discusses underlayment integration when working on adjacent slopes
- R-164 requires 4-6 inch underlayment overlap
- Does NOT explicitly state "full replacement required"
- Susan's knowledge base may be overstating the requirement

**Current GAF Guidance:**
- When replacing one slope, new underlayment must overlap 4-6 inches onto adjacent slope
- Proper integration required for warranty coverage
- Does not mandate full replacement of adjacent slopes

**Impact:**
Overstating GAF requirements could lead to:
- Unnecessary replacement recommendations
- Insurance pushback on legitimate claims
- Credibility issues when adjusters check GAF guidelines

**Action Required:**
1. Review GAF R-164 and related technical bulletins
2. Clarify precise language about adjacent slope work
3. Update knowledge base to reflect actual requirements
4. Train reps on distinction between "proper integration" vs "full replacement"

**Locations:** 24 mentions of "slope replacement requirement" in knowledge base

2. IRC section R903.2.1 is referenced 10 times but doesn't exist in current code
3. GAF slope replacement requirements may be overstated in 24 references

**Recommended Priority:**
1. Verify GAF Technical Bulletin R-126 (HIGH priority - affects 197 references)
