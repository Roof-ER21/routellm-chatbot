## Part 1: Dataset Connection Investigation

### Status: **CONNECTED ✅**

#### Findings:

1. **RAG System Status:**
   - Location: `/lib/rag-service.ts`
   - Status: Active and functional
   - Embeddings: 1,794 chunks loaded
   - Dimension: 1536 (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
   - Cache: Working with 15-minute TTL

2. **Data Files:**
   - **Embeddings:** `/data/susan_ai_embeddings.json` (85.8 MB) ✅
   - **Knowledge Base:** `/training_data/susan_ai_knowledge_base.json` (32.2 KB) ✅
   - **Source Documents:** 7 processed
   - **Total Tokens:** 356,708

3. **Integration:**
   - RAG service imported in `ai-provider-failover.ts` (line 19)
   - Semantic search performed on EVERY user query (line 784)
   - Context injected into system prompts (lines 865-874)
   - Sources cited in responses

### Conclusion:

**Susan has full access to her training data.** The RAG system is working correctly.
