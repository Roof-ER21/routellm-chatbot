   - Offer inspection/documentation services for homeowners disputing cancellations
   - Provide written inspection reports that counter aerial imagery findings

2. **Insurance Advocacy:**
   - Assist customers in citing Bulletin 25-10 when facing cancellations
   - Document roof condition with date-stamped photos
   - Provide detailed condition reports for insurance purposes

#### Pennsylvania-Specific Actions

1. **Two-Layer Rule:**
   - Always check existing layer count before quoting
   - Budget for complete tear-off when 2+ layers present
   - Educate customers on code requirements for tear-off

2. **Monitor Code Update:**
   - Check PA DLI website monthly for code adoption news (fall 2025 expected)

### For Homeowners

#### Before Hiring a Contractor

1. **Verify Credentials:**
   - Check state contractor license (required in VA, MD, PA)
   - Verify insurance coverage (liability and workers' comp)
   - Ask about manufacturer certifications (GAF Master Elite, FORTIFIED, etc.)

2. **Ask About Compliance:**
   - Will installation meet current building codes?
   - What warranties are included?
   - Will contractor register manufacturer warranty within 45 days?

3. **For FORTIFIED Homes:**
   - Is contractor FORTIFIED-certified? (Required for 2025 installations)
   - Will installation qualify for insurance premium discount?
   - Who pays for FORTIFIED evaluation/designation?

#### Understanding Your Roof

1. **Pennsylvania Homeowners:**
   - If your roof has 2+ layers, complete tear-off is required by code
   - Budget accordingly (tear-off adds cost)
   - Don't accept quotes that don't address this requirement

2. **Virginia Homeowners:**
   - Ask if your location requires ice barrier (check local amendments)
   - Ensure contractor uses proper underlayment for your roof slope

3. **All Homeowners:**
   - Understand manufacturer warranty does NOT cover storm damage (that's homeowner's insurance)
   - GAF WindProven offers best wind coverage (no speed limit)
   - Register your warranty promptly (45-day deadline)

#### Insurance Issues

1. **Maryland Homeowners Facing Cancellation:**
   - Request detailed explanation beyond aerial imagery
   - Cite Bulletin 25-10 if cancellation based solely on aerial photos
   - Obtain professional inspection report to refute imagery findings
   - Contact Maryland Insurance Administration if insurer doesn't respond appropriately

2. **Matching Disputes (All States):**
   - Document non-matching appearance with photos
   - Request detailed explanation of why matching is denied
   - Maryland: Cite Code §27-303 (unfair settlement practices)
   - Consider public adjuster or attorney for significant claims

3. **FORTIFIED Discounts:**
   - Ask insurer about premium discount for FORTIFIED designation
   - Obtain designation BEFORE roof installation (may not be retroactive)
   - Provide insurer with FORTIFIED certificate after designation

---

### For Insurance Adjusters

#### Regulatory Compliance

1. **Maryland Adjusters:**
   - Comply with Bulletin 25-10 when using aerial imagery
   - Don't base cancellations/denials solely on aerial photos
   - Provide opportunity for homeowner rebuttal with inspection report
   - Use human review, not just AI analysis

2. **All Adjusters:**
   - Review state unfair claims practices laws (MD §27-303, etc.)
   - Act in good faith on all claims
   - Document claim decisions thoroughly

#### Technical Knowledge

1. **Code Compliance:**
   - Understand current code requirements in your territory
   - Virginia: 2021 IRC (effective Jan 2025)
   - Pennsylvania: 2018 IRC; two-layer maximum
   - Maryland: Varies by jurisdiction (generally 2018-2021 codes)

2. **Manufacturer Warranties:**
   - GAF warranties void if installation doesn't follow GAF specs
   - WindProven has no wind speed cap (unlimited coverage)
   - Storm damage typically NOT covered by manufacturer warranty
   - Understand difference between manufacturer warranty and homeowner's policy

3. **FORTIFIED Standards:**
   - Recognize FORTIFIED designation criteria
   - Understand impact-resistant shingle ratings (IBHS vs. Class 4)
   - Verify contractor certification for FORTIFIED installations

#### Matching Disputes

1. **General Approach:**
   - Evaluate matching on case-by-case basis
   - Consider age/condition of existing roof sections
   - Document why matching is/isn't feasible
   - Explain decisions clearly to policyholders

2. **Maryland Specific:**
   - No specific matching bulletin, but §27-303 requires good faith
   - Arbitrary denials of matching may violate unfair practices law
   - Provide clear rationale for matching determinations

### For Building Officials

#### Code Enforcement

1. **Stay Current:**
   - Virginia: Enforce 2021 VUSBC/IRC (mandatory as of Jan 18, 2025)
   - Pennsylvania: Enforce 2018 IRC; prepare for fall 2025 update
   - Maryland: Enforce jurisdiction-specific code adoption

2. **Common Issues to Check:**
   - Pennsylvania: Verify tear-off when 2+ layers present
   - Virginia: Ice barrier in designated areas (Table R301.2)
   - All states: Proper fastener penetration (3/4" minimum into sheathing)
   - All states: Adequate number of fasteners per shingle

3. **Roof Recover vs. Replacement:**
   - Understand code provisions for when recover is/isn't permitted
   - Check for deteriorated or water-soaked existing roofing
   - Verify underlayment requirements for low-slope recovers

#### Plan Review

1. **Deck Thickness:**
   - Check rafter/truss spacing vs. deck thickness
   - Consider requiring NRCA 2025 recommendations (5/8" @ 16", 3/4" @ 24")
   - Review structural calculations for adequacy

2. **Ice Barriers (Virginia):**
   - Verify jurisdiction is in Table R301.2 ice damming area
   - Check ice barrier extends 24" inside wall line (36" for steep slopes)
   - Confirm proper material (2-layer cemented OR self-adhering)
