## ✅ WHAT WAS DEPLOYED

### 1. Complete Template System (11 Templates)
- **Rep-sent templates (9):** Rep generates and sends to insurance/homeowner
- **Customer-sent templates (2):** Rep generates FOR homeowner to send
  - Appraisal Request
  - Customer to Insurance Escalation

**Average Success Rate:** 89.5%
**Total Historical Uses:** 7,727+

### 2. Complete Argument Library (18 Arguments)
- Building codes, manufacturer specs, insurance regulations
- Industry standards, property value, safety & liability
- State-specific arguments (VA, MD, PA)

**Average Success Rate:** 84.7%
**Total Historical Uses:** 5,325+

### 3. Complete Building Code Database (5 Codes)

**Average Success Rate:** 91.6%

### 4. Customer Email Safeguards (NEW!)
**Critical Feature:** Susan NEVER generates emails AS the homeowner

When generating customer-sent emails:
- ✅ Automatic instruction header added
- ✅ Clear copy-and-send instructions
- ✅ Rep gets yellow warning banner in UI
- ✅ Correct email signature (homeowner's name)
- ✅ CC instructions included

**Example instruction header:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
INSTRUCTIONS FOR [CUSTOMER_NAME]:

This email is drafted for YOU to send directly to the insurance company.

✅ Copy the email content below (starting from the greeting)
✅ Send it from YOUR email address to [insurance_email]
✅ CC me ([REP_NAME] at [REP_EMAIL]) so I can monitor the response

DO NOT have [REP_NAME] send this on your behalf - it must come from you
for maximum impact with the insurance company.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[EMAIL CONTENT STARTS BELOW - COPY FROM HERE]
```

### 5. Enhanced UI
- Template selector with search/filter
- Argument selector with 18 arguments
- Document analysis display
- **NEW:** Yellow warning banner for customer-sent emails
- Color-coded success rates
- Mobile-responsive design

4. No special instructions needed

### For Customer-Sent Emails (2 templates):
1. Rep selects template (e.g., "Appraisal Request")
2. **UI shows yellow warning:** "⚠️ This email is for the HOMEOWNER to send"
3. Susan generates email WITH instruction header
4. Rep gives entire email to homeowner
5. Homeowner copies content and sends from their email
6. Homeowner CCs rep to keep them in loop
