## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

**1. System Prompt Construction**

Use `/lib/susan-prompts.ts` to build prompts:

```typescript
import { buildSystemPrompt } from '@/lib/susan-prompts';

const prompt = buildSystemPrompt({
  insuranceArgumentation: true,  // Activates battle mode
  educationMode: false,
  handsFreeMode: false,
  isFullApproval: false,
  isEntrepreneurial: false
});
```

**2. Response Template Usage**

Use `/lib/response-templates.ts` for pattern matching:

```typescript
import { findMatchingTemplate, renderTemplate } from '@/lib/response-templates';

const template = findMatchingTemplate(userMessage);
if (template) {
  const response = renderTemplate(template.id, {
    insurance_company: 'State Farm',
    state: 'VA',
    // ... other vars
  });
}
```

**3. Argument Library Integration**

Use `/lib/argument-library.ts` for code citations:

```typescript
import { getArgumentById, getArgumentsByState } from '@/lib/argument-library';

const ircArgument = getArgumentById('IRC_R908_3');
const vaArguments = getArgumentsByState('VA');
```

### For Prompt Engineers

**Key Principles:**

1. **Confidence > Caution**
   - ‚úÖ "Here's exactly what to do..."
   - ‚ùå "You might consider..."

2. **Evidence > Opinion**
   - ‚úÖ "Per IRC R908.3, which states..."
   - ‚ùå "I think the code says..."

3. **Scripts > Suggestions**
   - ‚úÖ "Say this: '[exact script]'"
   - ‚ùå "You could mention the code..."

4. **Success Rates > Generic Advice**
   - ‚úÖ "This works 87% of the time"
   - ‚ùå "This usually works"

5. **Action Items > Information**
   - ‚úÖ "Do these 3 things: 1) 2) 3)"
   - ‚ùå "There are several approaches..."
