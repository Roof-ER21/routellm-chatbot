## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

**1. System Prompt Construction**

Use `/lib/susan-prompts.ts` to build prompts:

```typescript
import { buildSystemPrompt } from '@/lib/susan-prompts';

const prompt = buildSystemPrompt({
  insuranceArgumentation: true,  // Activates battle mode
  educationMode: false,
  handsFreeMode: false,
  isFullApproval: false,
  isEntrepreneurial: false
});
```

**2. Response Template Usage**

Use `/lib/response-templates.ts` for pattern matching:

```typescript
import { findMatchingTemplate, renderTemplate } from '@/lib/response-templates';

const template = findMatchingTemplate(userMessage);
if (template) {
  const response = renderTemplate(template.id, {
    insurance_company: 'State Farm',
    state: 'VA',
    // ... other vars
  });
}
```

**3. Argument Library Integration**

Use `/lib/argument-library.ts` for code citations:

```typescript
import { getArgumentById, getArgumentsByState } from '@/lib/argument-library';

const ircArgument = getArgumentById('IRC_R908_3');
const vaArguments = getArgumentsByState('VA');
```

### For Prompt Engineers

**Key Principles:**

1. **Confidence > Caution**
   - ✅ "Here's exactly what to do..."
   - ❌ "You might consider..."

2. **Evidence > Opinion**
   - ✅ "Per IRC R908.3, which states..."
   - ❌ "I think the code says..."

3. **Scripts > Suggestions**
   - ✅ "Say this: '[exact script]'"
   - ❌ "You could mention the code..."

4. **Success Rates > Generic Advice**
   - ✅ "This works 87% of the time"
   - ❌ "This usually works"

5. **Action Items > Information**
   - ✅ "Do these 3 things: 1) 2) 3)"
   - ❌ "There are several approaches..."

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Insurance Argumentation Mode

**User:** "State Farm only approved $8,000 but we need $15,000 for the full roof. They're saying partial replacement is fine."

**Susan Response:**
```
I see State Farm approved $8,000 partial (you need $15,000 full).
Let me help you counter this and push for FULL APPROVAL.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 YOUR 3-STEP COUNTER-ARGUMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: CODE CITATION (Your Primary Weapon)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Per International Residential Code Section R908.3:
"Replacement materials must match the existing roof in color,
size, and quality."

This is MANDATORY building code. (SUCCESS RATE: 92%)

[Continues with complete framework...]
```

### Example 2: Education Mode

**User:** "Why do insurance companies always try to deny matching?"

**Susan Response:**
```
Excellent question! Let's explore this as a learning opportunity -
understanding adjuster psychology will make you a better negotiator.

UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTALS - WHY DENIALS HAPPEN:

Insurance companies operate on a financial model where controlling
claim costs directly impacts profitability. Adjusters are often
incentivized (through performance metrics, bonuses, or quotas) to
minimize payouts while maintaining customer satisfaction...

[Continues with comprehensive educational response including
psychological insights and reflection questions...]

### Example 3: Hands-Free Mode

**User:** "At a property with wind damage"
