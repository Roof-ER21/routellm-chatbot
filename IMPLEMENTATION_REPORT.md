# Railway Database & Email Notifications - Implementation Report

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Developer:** Claude (Backend Developer)
**Project:** RouteLL M Chatbot - Railway Deployment

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully diagnosed and fixed critical database connection issues, implemented localStorage sync endpoint, and created a comprehensive email notification system matching the Vercel app's functionality.

---

## 1. DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUE - DIAGNOSIS & FIX

### Problem Identified

The admin panel showed **NO conversations** despite users chatting because:

1. **Session Creation Was Broken** (`/app/api/session/route.ts`)
   - Was creating mock sessions using `Date.now()` instead of real database records
   - `sessionId` was a timestamp, not a valid PostgreSQL foreign key
   - When `logChatMessage` tried to save messages, the foreign key constraint was violated
   - Messages were either rejected or saved as orphaned records

2. **Root Cause**
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (BROKEN):
   return NextResponse.json({
     success: true,
     repId: Date.now(),        // ❌ Fake ID
     sessionId: Date.now() + 1 // ❌ Fake ID
   })
   ```

### Solution Implemented

**File: `/app/api/session/route.ts`**

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED):
import { getOrCreateRep, createChatSession, ensureTablesExist } from '@/lib/db'

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { repName } = await req.json()

  // Ensure tables exist
  await ensureTablesExist()

  // Create or get rep from Railway PostgreSQL database
  const rep = await getOrCreateRep(repName)

  // Create a new chat session in Railway PostgreSQL database
  const session = await createChatSession(rep.id, repName)

  console.log(`[Session] Created for ${repName}: repId=${rep.id}, sessionId=${session.id}`)

  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    repId: rep.id,         // ✅ Real database ID
    sessionId: session.id  // ✅ Real database ID
  })
}
```

**Impact:**
- All new conversations will now save correctly to Railway PostgreSQL
- Chat messages will have valid foreign keys to `chat_sessions` table
- Admin panel will display conversations properly

---

## 2. PULL-DATA ENDPOINT FOR LOCALSTORAGE SYNC

### Purpose

Created an admin endpoint to force sync of ALL localStorage data from all devices (phone, iPad, computer) to PostgreSQL.

### Implementation

**File: `/app/api/admin/pull-data/route.ts`**

**Features:**
- Accepts conversation arrays from client-side localStorage
- Creates proper database sessions and reps
- Maintains message order by timestamp
- Handles errors gracefully with detailed reporting
- Returns sync status with counts

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/pull-data`

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "id": "client-session-123",
      "repName": "John Smith",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Message text",
          "timestamp": 1696800000000
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "conversationsSynced": 15,
  "totalMessages": 234,
  "conversationsReceived": 15,
  "errors": [],
  "syncedConversations": [
    {
      "clientSessionId": "client-session-123",
      "dbSessionId": 42,
      "repName": "John Smith",
      "messageCount": 18
    }
  ]
}
```

**Usage:**
- Admin clicks "Pull Data" button
- Endpoint processes all conversations
- Returns detailed status report

## 3. EMAIL NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

### Architecture

Created a comprehensive email notification system matching the Vercel app's functionality.

### Files Created

1. `/lib/email-notifications.ts` - Core notification logic
2. `/app/api/admin/send-recap/route.ts` - Manual/cron trigger endpoint

### Features Implemented

#### 3.1 New User Login Alerts

**Function:** `sendNewUserAlert(repName: string)`

**Trigger:** Automatically called when a user sends their first message

**Detection Logic:**
- Checks if user has been seen in current session (in-memory cache)
- Queries database to count user's previous messages
- Considers users with ≤2 messages as "new"
- Marks user as seen after sending alert

**Email Content:**
- Beautiful gradient design (green theme for new users)
- User name prominently displayed
- First login timestamp (EST timezone)
- Current activity status
- Action recommendation for admin
- Link to admin dashboard

**Example:**
```
Subject: 🆕 New User: Sarah Johnson just logged in!

- New Rep: Sarah Johnson
- First Login: Tuesday, October 8, 2025 at 2:30 PM EST
- Status: Active Now
- Action: Consider reaching out to welcome Sarah
```

#### 3.2 Nightly Recap Emails

**Function:** `sendNightlyRecap()`

**Trigger:** Manual (admin button) or automated (cron job)

**Content Sections:**

1. **Daily Summary Stats** (4-box dashboard)
   - Active Users (total unique users)
   - Conversations (total sessions)
   - Messages (total message count)
   - New Users (first-time users)

2. **New Users Highlight**
   - List of all new users who joined today
   - Green gradient box with names

3. **User Activity Breakdown** (table)
   - Each user's conversation count
   - Each user's message count
   - First activity time
   - Last activity time
   - "NEW" badge for first-time users

**Data Sources:**
- Queries `chat_messages` table for today's data
- Identifies new users by joining with first message timestamp
- Groups by user for activity breakdown
- All times displayed in EST timezone

**Email Design:**
- Professional red gradient header
- Modern card-based stats layout
- Responsive HTML email template
- Footer with timestamp and branding

### Integration Points

**File: `/app/api/chat/route.ts`**

Added new user detection:
```typescript
// Check if this is a new user and send alert (non-blocking)
sendNewUserAlert(repName).catch(err => {
  console.error('[Chat] Error sending new user alert:', err)
})
```

**File: `/app/api/admin/send-recap/route.ts`**

Created endpoint for manual/automated recap:
```typescript
POST /api/admin/send-recap
Header: cron-secret (optional for cron jobs)
```

### Email Configuration

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx          # Required for email functionality
ADMIN_EMAIL=ahmed.mahmoud@theroofdocs.com # Recipient for notifications
FROM_EMAIL=SusanAI-21 <noreply@susanai-21.com> # Optional (has default)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app # For links in emails
CRON_SECRET=your-secret-key               # Optional for cron protection
```

## 4. DATABASE VERIFICATION

### Current Database Setup

**Connection:** Railway PostgreSQL via `lib/railway-db.ts`

**Tables Used:**
- `reps` - User/rep information
- `chat_sessions` - Conversation sessions
- `chat_messages` - Individual messages (foreign key to sessions)
- `threat_alerts` - Security monitoring
- `sent_emails` - Email delivery tracking

**Data Flow:**
1. User logs in → `getOrCreateRep()` creates/fetches rep
2. Session starts → `createChatSession()` creates database record
3. Messages sent → `logChatMessage()` saves with valid session FK
4. New user detected → `sendNewUserAlert()` triggers email
5. End of day → `sendNightlyRecap()` summarizes activity

### Verification Steps

**To verify database is working:**

1. Check Railway dashboard for DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Test connection: Visit `/api/admin/init-db` endpoint
3. View conversations: Admin panel → "All Users" tab
4. Check logs for `[Session] Created for` messages

## 6. CRON JOB SETUP (Optional)

To automate nightly recap emails, set up a cron job:

### Option 1: Railway Cron (if available)
```yaml
# railway.json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "schedule": "0 22 * * *",
      "command": "curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/admin/send-recap -H 'cron-secret: YOUR_SECRET'"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option 2: External Cron Service (cron-job.org, EasyCron, etc.)
```
URL: https://your-app.railway.app/api/admin/send-recap
Method: POST
Header: cron-secret: YOUR_SECRET
Schedule: 22:00 EST (10 PM Eastern)
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: Nightly Recap
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # 10 PM EST (2 AM UTC)
jobs:
  send-recap:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Recap
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.APP_URL }}/api/admin/send-recap \
            -H "cron-secret: ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}"
```

## 7. TROUBLESHOOTING

### No Conversations Showing Up

**Symptoms:** Admin panel shows 0 conversations

**Solutions:**
1. Check DATABASE_URL is set in Railway
2. Test `/app/api/admin/init-db` endpoint
3. Verify session creation logs: `[Session] Created for...`
4. Check browser console for session creation errors
5. Click "Pull Data" button to force refresh

### New User Emails Not Sending

**Symptoms:** No emails received for new users

**Solutions:**
1. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
2. Check logs for `[Email Notifications]` messages
3. Verify ADMIN_EMAIL is correct
4. Test Resend API key in Resend dashboard
5. Check email spam folder

### Nightly Recap Issues

**Symptoms:** Recap email not received or has wrong data

**Solutions:**
1. Manually trigger: `POST /api/admin/send-recap`
2. Check cron secret header if using automated
3. Verify data exists in database for today
4. Check timezone (should be EST)
5. Review server logs for errors
