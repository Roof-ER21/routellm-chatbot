## üìä Current Deployment Status

### Railway (Production)
- **URL:** https://[your-app].railway.app
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Railway-hosted)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ LIVE - Conversations capturing correctly
- **Schema:** All columns present and working
- **Test Endpoint:** `/api/test-db` available for diagnostics

### Vercel (Alternative)
- **URL:** https://susanai-21.vercel.app
- **Database:** Same PostgreSQL (Railway-hosted via DATABASE_URL)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ SYNCED - Has all Railway improvements
- **Schema:** Same database, same fixes applied

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Migrations Applied
```sql
-- Added to reps table
ALTER TABLE reps ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_active TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
ALTER TABLE reps ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS total_chats INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Added to chat_sessions table
ALTER TABLE chat_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS rep_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE chat_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE chat_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_message_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
```

### How Migrations Work
- Migrations run automatically via `ensureTablesExist()` in `lib/db.ts`
- Called on every session creation (`/api/session` endpoint)
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` for safety (no errors if columns already present)
- All migrations are backwards-compatible

### Files Modified (Commits)
1. **e06d051** - Initial schema fixes (total_chats, rep_name), system prompt enhancements
2. **938f104** - Database test endpoint, last_active column
3. **7d71007** - Implementation report with diagnostics
4. **29a1b6c** - ALL missing columns fixed (message_count, last_message_at)

## üì± User Experience Improvements

### Susan AI Enhanced Capabilities

**Shorter, Actionable Responses:**
```
Before: Long explanations without engagement
After: Concise answers with "What's your next step?" follow-ups
```

**Roofing Expertise:**
```
Susan now knows:
- GAF: ASTM D3462, D3161, D7158, UL 790 Class A, UL 2218 Class 4
- CertainTeed: UL Class A Fire, ASTM D3161 Class F Wind
- Building codes for VA, MD, PA (IBC/IRC compliant)
```

**Siding Project Detection:**
```
User: "I need help with siding replacement"
Susan: "Do you have Hover or EagleView measurements for this siding project?
       Aerial measurements ensure accurate material calculations and reduce waste."
```

**Daily Motivation:**
```
Login message: "The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that
               little extra. In roofing, that extra mile becomes your signature."
```

**Insurance Negotiations:**
```
Email drafts now include: "My policy owes for making me whole"
Firm but kind tone: "Destroy them with kindness but don't back down"
```

## üéØ Admin Panel Features

### Conversation Monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Real-time capture** from all devices (phone, iPad, computer)

- Table existence (reps, chat_sessions, chat_messages)
- Record counts (how many users, sessions, messages)
- Recent activity (last 5 sessions)

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T14:30:00Z",
  "tables": ["chat_messages", "chat_sessions", "reps"],
  "counts": {
    "reps": 15,
    "sessions": 234,
    "messages": 3456
  },
  "recentSessions": [
    {
      "id": 234,
      "rep_name": "John Smith",
      "started_at": "2025-10-08T14:25:00Z",
      "message_count": 12
    }

## üîê Security & Performance

### Logging Optimized
- **Before:** 500+ logs/sec causing Railway rate limit
- **After:** <100 logs/sec (80-90% reduction)
- **Method:** Removed console.log from hot paths
- **Preserved:** Critical error logging and threat detection

### Email Notifications Fixed (Oct 9, 2025)

- **Fix:** Changed FROM_EMAIL to use Resend's verified onboarding@resend.dev domain
- **Status:** ‚úÖ New user alerts and nightly recaps now sending successfully
- **Alternative:** To use custom domain, verify susanai-21.com in Resend dashboard

### Threat Detection
- Still fully operational (logs to database, not console)
- Voice command monitoring
- Template injection detection
- All alerts stored in `threat_alerts` table

### Email Notifications
- New user login alerts (when user sends first message)
